THE GOLDEN RULES
If the text of this Rules Reference directly contradicts
the text of the Learn to Play book, the text of the Rules
Reference takes precedence.
If the text of a card directly contradicts the text of either the
Rules Reference or the Learn to Play book, the text of the
card takes precedence.

THE GRIM RULE
If players are unable to find the answer to a rules or timing
conflict in this Rules Reference, resolve the conflict in the
manner that the players perceive as the worst possible
resolution at that moment with regards to winning the
scenario, and continue with the game.

COMPONENT LIMITATIONS
There is no limit to the number of threat tokens, damage
tokens, acceleration tokens, status cards, or all-purpose
counters that can be in the game at a given time.
If players run out of the provided tokens, counters, or status
cards, other tokens, counters, or coins may be used.

ABILITY
An ability is game text on a card that explains what the
card does (or can do). Several examples can be seen in
Appendix III of this Rules Reference.
• Card abilities only interact with cards that are in play,
unless the ability specifically refers to an out-of-play
area or element.
• Card abilities on hero, alter-ego, ally, upgrade, and
support cards may only be used if the card is in play,
unless the ability specifically refers to being used
from an out-of-play state. Event cards implicitly
interact with the game from an out-of-play area, as
per the rules of the event card type.
• An ability can only be initiated if its effect could
change the game. Assess this without accounting for
the consequences of the cost payment or interaction
with other abilities.
• When an ability has more than one sentence of text,
read the entirety of the ability to check for alteration
effects that may change the way the ability resolves.
Then, resolve the ability one sentence at a time.
• An ability prefaced by a bold timing trigger followed
by a colon is referred to as a triggered ability. An
ability without a bold timing trigger is referred to as a
constant ability. (See below.)
• Player card abilities cannot resolve during game
setup, unless prefaced by a “Setup” timing trigger.
• The resolution of the following ability types is
mandatory: constant abilities, “Setup” abilities,
“When Revealed” abilities, “When Defeated”
abilities, “Forced Interrupt” abilities, “Forced
Response” abilities, “Boost” abilities, and keywords.
If one of these ability types uses the word “may”, the
part of the ability following “may” is optional.
• The resolution of the following ability types is
optional: “Action”, “Interrupt”, “Response”,
“Resource”. The player who controls the card that has
an optional ability determines whether or not to use
that ability at the appropriate time.
Constant Abilities — A constant ability is any non-keyword
ability whose text contains no bold timing trigger defining
its ability type. A constant ability becomes active as soon as
its card enters play and remains active while the card is in
play.
• Some constant abilities continuously seek a specific
condition (denoted by words such as “during”, “if”,
or “while”). The effects of such abilities are active
anytime the specific condition is met.
• If multiple instances of the same constant ability
are in play, each instance affects the game
independently.

Triggered Abilities — A triggered ability is indicated by a
bold timing trigger followed by a colon and the rest of the
ability text.
• A triggered ability on a player card can only be
initiated if its effect could change the game on its
own. This potential is assessed without taking into
account the consequences of the cost payment or
future responses to the effect.
• Unless prefaced by the word “Forced”, all interrupt
and response abilities are optional.
• “Forced” abilities, “When Revealed” abilities,
“When Defeated” abilities, and “When Completed”
abilities are triggered by the game at the ability’s
appropriate timing point.
• If the bold timing trigger of an ability contains the
word “Hero” or “Alter-Ego,” the ability can only
be used if the player triggering the ability is in the
specified form.
• If quotation marks are used around a timing trigger
and colon, the quoted text is not itself a timing
trigger, but is instead referring to other abilities with
that trigger.
Some abilities have timing priority over other abilities. In
order, the timing priority of abilities is:
1. Constant abilities.
2. “Forced Interrupt” abilities.
3. “Interrupt” abilities.
4. “Forced Response” abilities.
5. “Response” abilities.

ACCELERATION ICON ()
An acceleration icon represents additional forces that are
advancing the villain’s nefarious plans.
During step one of the villain phase, place X additional
threat on the main scheme, where X is the number of
acceleration icons in play.
• An acceleration icon can be removed from play by
defeating the encounter card it is printed on.
See also: Icons, Main Scheme, Threat, Villain Phase

ACCELERATION TOKEN
Acceleration tokens are functionally
equivalent to acceleration icons. They are
placed next to the main scheme as a reminder
to add X additional threat to the main scheme
during step one of the villain phase, where X
is the number of acceleration tokens in play.

Acceleration tokens enter play through one of two effects:
• If the encounter deck is empty, place one acceleration
token next to the main scheme.
• Card effects may instruct the players to add an
acceleration token to play.
Acceleration tokens cannot be removed from play. Unlike
other tokens, when a main scheme card leaves play, the
acceleration token does not get discarded.
See also: Component Limitations, Encounter Deck, Main
Scheme, Villain Phase

ACTION
“Action” is a type of triggered ability. Players are permitted
to trigger action abilities during their turn, or by request
during other players’ turns.
See also: Ability, Player Turn, Triggered Ability

ACTIVATION
There are two types of enemy activations: an attack
activation and a scheme activation. Whenever an enemy
attacks or schemes, it is considered to have activated.
• During step two of the villain phase, the villain
activates once per player, in player order. If the
identity of the player resolving the activation is in
hero form, the villain initiates an attack against that
player’s identity. If the identity of the player resolving
the activation is in alter-ego form, the villain initiates
a scheme.
• During step two of the villain phase, each minion
engaged with a player activates against that player.
If the identity of the engaged player is in hero form,
the minion initiates an attack against that player’s
identity. If the identity of the engaged player is in
alter-ego form, the minion initiates a scheme.
• Each time the villain activates, give the villain
one boost card from the encounter deck for that
activation.
• Some card abilities can also cause enemies to attack
or scheme. These are also considered activations.
• If multiple enemies activate against you simultaneously,
resolve the villain’s activation first (if any) in the order of
your choice, followed by minion activations in the order
of your choice.
• If an activating minion leaves play, that minion’s
activation ends immediately and no further steps of
that activation resolve.

Activation), Minion, Villain, Villain Phase

ACTIVE PLAYER
The player taking their turn during the player phase is the
active player.

“ADDITIONAL”
See: Alteration Effect

“AF TER”
The word “after” refers to a game occurrence that just
concluded. Many response abilities use the term “after” to
specify the time at which they can be used.

“ALREADY”

See: Alteration Effect

ALL-PURPOSE COUNTER

ALTERATION EFFECT

All-purpose counters can be used to track
a variety of different game states and
statuses. They have no inherent rules.
Card abilities can create and define a number of different
counter types, such as “arrow counters” or “web counters.”
If a counter is called for, an all-purpose counter is used to
track its presence in the game.
See also: Component Limitations, Uses (X “Type”)

ALLY
Ally is a player card type that represents an identity’s
friends, supporters, or companions.
• If an ally enters play, it remains in play until a card
ability or game effect causes it to leave play. If an
ally’s remaining hit points are reduced to zero, it is
defeated and discarded from play.
• During a player’s turn, they may use any number of
allies they control to attack or thwart. An ally must
exhaust to attack or thwart.
• After an ally is used to attack or thwart, deal
consequential damage to that ally equal to the
number of consequential damage icons () beneath
the ally’s ATK or THW field. (If an ally attempts
to attack or thwart while stunned or confused,
respectively, that ally will not take consequential
damage.)
• If a player is attacked, any player may exhaust an ally
they control to defend against the attack. If an ally
defends against an attack, all damage from the attack
is dealt to the ally.
• Attacks, thwarts, defenses, action abilities, and
triggered abilities that resolve from allies in play
under a player’s control are not considered to be
performed by that player’s identity.
See also: Ally Limit, Consequential Damage, Hit Points

ALLY LIMIT
Each player is permitted to control a maximum of three
allies in play at any given time. This is referred to as the
“ally limit.”

A player may play or put into play allies beyond their ally
limit. However, if a player ever controls a number of allies
greater than their ally limit in play, they must immediately
choose and discard from play ally cards they control until
they have a number of allies in play equal to their ally limit.
This occurs before abilities that resolve upon entering play.

An alteration effect modifies the resolution of an ability that
precedes it. The types of alteration effects are “additional,”
“already,” and “each time” effects.
Additional — The word “additional” denotes a modifier to
an ability or game state. The additional modifier is resolved
simultaneously with any ability it is modifying and under the
same conditions as that ability. (For example, Repulsor Blast
reads: “Hero Action (attack): Deal 1 damage to an enemy
and discard the top 5 cards of your deck. For each printed
 resource discarded this way, deal 2 additional damage to
that enemy.”)
Already — The word “already” denotes the resolution of an
alternate ability if a specific condition is met. The “already”
effect checks if this condition is met before the preceding
ability attempts to resolve. If so, the “already” effect
resolves instead. (For example, I’m Tough reads: “When
Revealed: Give Rhino a tough status card. If Rhino already
has a tough status card, this card gains surge.”)
Each Time — The phrase “each time” denotes a temporary
interruption to a resolving ability. When a condition is met
that is specified by the “each time” effect, the resolution
of the preceding ability halts, the “each time” effect
resolves in its entirety, then the preceding ability continues
resolving. (For example, “You Dare Oppose Me?“ reads:
“When Revealed: Discard the top 5 cards of the encounter
deck. Each time a card belonging to the Kree Fanatic set is
discarded this way, deal that card to yourself as a facedown
encounter card.”)

ALTER-EGO, ALTER-EGO FORM
See: Form, Identity

AMPLIFY ICON ()
The amplify icon represents various forces that are
empowering or bolstering the villain.
When a boost card is turned faceup during an enemy
activation, add one additional boost icon to that card for
each amplify icon in play.
See also: Activation, Boost, Enemy, Icons

Rules Reference

“AND”

• An attached card exhausts and readies independently
of the game element it is attached to.

The word “and” indicates that two or more effects within
an ability resolve simultaneously.

• The “attach to” phrase is checked for legality when
the card would be attached to a game element, but it
is not checked again after it is attached. If the initial
“attach to” check does not pass, the card is not able
to be attached, so it remains in its prior state or game
area. If such a card cannot remain in its prior state or
game area, discard it.

• Individual effects connected by “and” are not
dependent on each other. As long as at least one of
the effects can change the game state, resolve as
much of the ability as possible.
• Each effect connected by “and” can be canceled or
prevented independently.
See also: Ability, Cancel, Prevent

ATTACK (ENEMY ACTIVATION)

ARROW ICON (→)

An attack is a type of enemy activation. When an enemy
attacks, it targets a specific player, then resolves that attack
against that player. To resolve an enemy attack, follow these
steps:

See: Cost Arrow Icon

ASPECT CARD
Cards in the “aspect” classification are any cards that
belong to the Aggression, Justice, Leadership, and/or
Protection aspects.
• When building a player deck, a player must choose
one of the four aspects (Aggression, Justice,
Leadership, or Protection) to use for customization.
The remainder of their deck (the portion not
allocated to their identity-specific cards) can then
be customized with cards that belong to the chosen
aspect.

1.

If a villain, or a minion with the villainous keyword, is
attacking, give it one facedown boost card from the
encounter deck. (If a minion without the villainous
keyword is attacking, skip this step.)

2.

If a player wishes to defend, that player exhausts a hero
or ally as the defender. If a player other than the target
player defends, the defending player becomes the
target player for this attack.

3.

Flip each of the attacking enemy’s boost cards faceup
one at a time. (If a minion without the villainous
keyword is attacking, skip this step.) Then, in order:
• Resolve any “Boost” abilities, indicated by the star
icon in the boost field.

• A card’s aspect is designated by the aspect’s name
printed at the bottom of the card in its deckbuilding
classification area.

• Increase the attacking enemy’s ATK value by one for
each boost icon on the card.

See also: Basic Card, Classifications, Identity-Specific Card,
Appendix I: Deck Customization

• Discard each boost card after it is resolved.
4.

ATK
See: Attack (Player Action), Basic Power

Deal damage from the attack equal to the attacking
enemy’s modified ATK value, based on the following:
• If a hero makes a basic defense against the attack,
the amount of damage dealt is reduced by that hero’s
DEF value, and the remaining damage from the attack
is dealt to that hero.

ATTACHMENT
Attachment is an encounter card type.
When an attachment enters play, it attaches to another card
or game element.
• If an attachment attaches to the villain, it may modify
the villain’s ATK and/or SCH values, as indicated by
the values in the associated fields on the attachment
card.
See also: Attach To, Encounter Card, Enters Play

• If an ally defends against the attack, all damage from
the attack is dealt to the ally. (If the ally is defeated by
the attack, additional damage does not carry over to
the identity.)
• If no character defends against the attack, the
attack is considered undefended. All damage from
the attack is dealt to the target player’s identity (even
if that identity is in alter-ego form).
See also: Activation, Ally, Boost, Damage, Defend, Enemy,
Identity, Minion, Target, Villain, Villainous

ATTACH TO
If a card uses the phrase “attach to”, it must be attached to
(placed beneath and slightly overlapped by) the specified
game element as it enters play.
• Once a card is attached, it remains in play until either
the element it is attached to leaves play (in which
case the attached card is discarded) or an ability or
game effect causes the attached card to leave play.

Some game effects and card abilities reference an attack.
There are a few different ways an attack can occur:

• A hero can use their basic attack power to attack an
enemy. A hero must exhaust to use this power. This
deals damage equal to the hero’s ATK value to the
enemy.
• An ally can use its basic attack power to attack an
enemy. This deals damage equal to the ally’s ATK
value to the enemy.

• If a triggered ability is labeled as an attack—such
as “Hero Action (attack)”—resolving that ability is
considered to attack the specified target. Unless
specified by the ability’s text, a hero does not exhaust
when using such an ability.
• Hero and ally attacks can target any enemy, unless a
card ability (such as guard) is preventing that enemy
from being attacked.

• Enemies can attack during step two of the villain AT K
phase.

BA SIC C ARD
Cards in the “Basic” classification are cards that are not
associated with a specific identity or aspect.
• When building a deck, a player may customize the
remainder of their deck (the portion not allocated to
their identity-specific cards) using basic cards.
• A card is designated as basic if it has the word
“Basic” printed at the bottom of the card in its
deckbuilding classification area.
• Basic cards are not aspect cards.

If the boost field has a star icon, it indicates that the card
has a “Boost” ability. Refer to the card’s text box and
resolve the “Boost” ability when the card is turned face up.
The “Boost” ability is located beneath the divider line in the
text box.
• A star icon is not itself considered a boost icon, and
does not contribute to the villain’s ATK or SCH value.
• Only the ability text beneath the divider line is active
on a card that is resolving as a boost card.
• If additional boost cards are resolved for an
activation, the boost icons are cumulative, and all
“Boost” abilities on those cards resolve.
• After applying a boost card to an activation, discard it.

Rules Reference

C AMPAIGN-SPECIFIC C ARD

CHAR ACTER

Cards in the “campaign-specific” classification are cards
that belong to a campaign’s set of accompanying cards.

Identities (heroes and alter-egos), allies, villains, and minions
are all characters.

• Campaign-specific cards can only be used during a
campaign from the same product (determined by that
product’s set icon).
• A campaign’s rules determine how players utilize
campaign-specific cards within that campaign.
• A campaign-specific card is designated by the word
“Campaign” printed at the bottom of the card in its
encounter set name area.
See also: Campaign, Classification

C ANCEL
Some card abilities can cancel card or game effects.
• Cancel abilities interrupt the initiation of effects and
prevent them from initiating.
• Anytime the effects of an ability are canceled, the
ability (apart from its effects) is still regarded as
initiated, and any costs are still paid. Only the effects
are prevented from initiating, and do not resolve.
• If the effects of an event card are canceled, the card
is still considered played, and it is discarded.
• If the effects of a treachery card are canceled, the
card is still regarded as revealed, and it is still placed
in the encounter discard pile.
See also: Ability

See also: Ally, Identity, Minion, Villain

CHOOSE
The word “choose” indicates that a player must select a
game element that meets the specific requirements of an
ability.
• The player resolving the ability that uses the word
“choose” is the player who makes the choice
specified by the card.
• If a player card ability requires the choosing of a
target, and there is no valid target, the ability cannot
be initiated.
• If multiple targets are required to be chosen by the
same player, simultaneously choose as many as are
available, to a maximum of the specified number.
• An effect that can choose “any number” of targets
does not successfully resolve (and cannot change the
game state) if zero of those targets are chosen.
• A card is not an eligible target for an ability if the
resolution of that ability’s effect could not change the
card’s state.
See also: Ability, Player, Target

CL A SSIFIC ATIONS
A card’s classification is the group that a card belongs to as
determined by its specific attributes.

C ANNOT

• Cards in the “identity-specific” classification are cards
that belong to an identity’s set of accompanying
cards. (See: Identity-Specific Card)

The word “cannot” is absolute and cannot be
countermanded by other abilities or effects.

A card’s card type denotes various rules and game functions
associated with that card.
• Ally, event, identity, resource, support, and upgrade
cards are types of player cards.
• Attachment, environment, main scheme, minion,
obligation, side scheme, treachery, and villain cards
are types of encounter cards.
• If an ability causes a card to change its card type,
it loses all other card types it might possess and
functions as would any card of the new card type.

CONFUSE, CONFUSED
Confuse is a status that prevents a character from adding or
removing threat with its next scheme or thwart, respectively.
• If an ability “confuses” a character, give that character
a confused status card.
• If a character has an ability stating that it “cannot be
confused,” confused status cards cannot be placed
on that character.

CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGE ()
After an ally attacks, it takes consequential damage equal to
the number of consequential damage icons () beneath its
ATK field.
After an ally thwarts, it takes consequential damage equal
to the number of consequential damage icons () beneath
its THW field.
• Consequential damage is dealt to an ally after
resolving abilities that are triggered by the ally
attacking or thwarting.
See also: Ally, Attack (Player Action), Basic Power, Damage,

CONSTANT ABILIT Y

• An ability’s cost cannot be paid if the resolution of
that ability’s effect could not change the game state.
• While a player is paying a cost, that player must pay
costs with cards and/or game elements they control.
• If a cost requires a game element that is not in
play, the player paying the cost may only use game
elements that are in their own out-of-play areas.
• Some card ability may reference an “additional cost.”
A player must pay all additional costs simultaneously
with the cost that is being added to, even if multiple
cards or abilities are adding separate additional
costs. A player cannot pay the original cost or any of
the additional costs individually; if they cannot pay
for all of the costs at once, then they do not pay any
of the costs and the effect associated with the costs
does not occur.
See also: Ability, Cost Arrow Icon, Initiating Abilities,
Keywords

COST ARROW ICON (→)
A cost arrow icon (→) in ability text distinguishes a cost from
an effect, in a “pay cost → resolve effect” format. Nonbolded text before the cost arrow icon must be paid and/or
resolved in full before the text after the cost arrow icon can
be resolved.

COPY
A copy of a card is defined by title. A second copy of a card
is any other card that shares the same title and subtitle (if
any), regardless of card’s type, text, artwork, or any other
differing characteristics between the cards.
See also: Card Types, Subtitle

COST
A card’s resource cost is the numerical value that must be
paid to play the card. Some abilities have a cost described
in the ability text that must be paid to use the ability.
• A cost arrow icon (→) in ability text distinguishes a
cost from an effect, in a “pay cost → resolve effect”
format.
• While paying a cost, a player is permitted to generate
resources beyond the specified cost.
• When generating resources to pay a cost, a player
is permitted to generate resources beyond the
specified cost. However, any resources that are
generated beyond the required cost are lost after
paying the cost.

While at least one crisis icon is in play, threat cannot be
removed from the main scheme by any player.
See also: Main Scheme, Threat

DAMAGE
Damage reduces a character’s hit points.
If a character has zero or fewer remaining
hit points, it is defeated.
• Damage on an identity or villain is tracked by a hit
point dial. If such a character is damaged, reduce its
dial by the amount of damage that it took.
• Damage on an ally or minion is tracked by damage
tokens. If such a character is damaged, place the
specified value of damage tokens on the character.

• If multiple costs for a single card or ability require
payment, those costs must be paid simultaneously.


DA SH (VALUE)

DEFEND, DEFENSE

If a character’s power (ATK, DEF, REC, SCH, and THW) has
a dash (–) as the value, the character cannot exhaust to use
that power. If a game step or card ability references a power
with the value of dash (–), that value is treated as 0.

During an enemy attack, a player may defend against that
attack using cards they control.

See also: Basic Power, Non-Numerical Variable

DE AL , DE AL AN ENCOUNTER C ARD
During step three of the villain phase, each player is dealt
one facedown encounter card.
If a card ability instructs a player to be dealt an encounter
card, the player takes the top card of the encounter deck
and places it facedown in front of them. This card is not
revealed at this time. This card is added to the queue of
cards that player resolves during the villain phase.
• If a player is dealt an encounter card during step
three or four of the villain phase, the extra encounter
card is added to the queue of cards that are being
dealt and revealed in those same steps.
See also: Ability, Encounter Card, Encounter Deck, Player,
Villain Phase

DECK
There are four main types of decks that appear in a game:
the player deck, the encounter deck, the villain deck, and
the main scheme deck. Certain identities or scenarios may
add other decks to the game.
• The order of cards within a deck cannot be altered
unless a player is instructed to do so by a game step,
game function, or card ability.
See also: Encounter Deck, Main Scheme Deck, Player Deck,
Villain Deck

DECK CUSTOMIZ ATION

• Only one player at a time can defend against an
enemy attack. Once a player defends, no other player
can defend against that same attack.
• A hero can use their basic defense power to defend
against an enemy attack. A hero must exhaust to
use this power. The amount of damage dealt by the
attack is reduced by the hero’s DEF value, and any
remaining damage is dealt to that hero. Once a hero
defends against an attack, no other friendly character
can defend against that attack.
• An ally can exhaust to defend against an enemy
attack. Damage from the attack is dealt to that ally.
Once an ally defends against an attack, no other
friendly character can defend against that attack.
• When a player resolves a triggered ability labeled as
a defense—such as “Hero Interrupt (defense)”—that
player’s identity becomes the defender and is
considered to have defended the attack (they do not
reduce the damage dealt by their DEF value). Unless
specified by the ability’s text, a hero does not exhaust
when using such an ability. The defending player
may resolve any number of defense abilities during
an enemy attack (as long as the triggering conditions
of those abilities are met). Once a player resolves
a defense ability during an enemy attack, no other
player can resolve defense abilities for that same
attack.
• If a player defends against an enemy attack that
targets a different player (either by defending with
a character they control or by resolving a defense
ability), the defending player becomes the new target
of that attack.
• If no character is used to defend against an enemy
attack, that attack is considered undefended.
Additionally, if a defending ally is defeated before
damage from the attack is dealt (such as through
a “Boost” ability), the attack is considered
undefended.

See: Appendix I: Deck Customization

DEF

Friendly, Identity, Player

If a character has zero or fewer remaining hit points, or if a
side scheme has no threat on it, it is defeated.

DEL AYED EFFECT

• If an ally, minion, or side scheme is defeated, it is
discarded.
• If an identity or stage of the villain is defeated, it is
removed from the game.

Some abilities contain delayed effects. Such abilities specify
a future timing point, or indicate a future condition that may
arise, and dictate an effect that is to happen at that time.
• Delayed effects resolve automatically and
immediately after their specified timing point or
future condition occurs or becomes true, and before
responses to that point or condition may be used.
• When a delayed effect resolves, it is not treated as a
new triggered ability, even if the delayed effect was
originally created by a triggered ability.

DISC ARD

EMPT Y DECK

Discarding is the act of attempting to move a card from
a non-discard-pile play area to a discard pile.

See: Encounter Deck, Player Deck

• If a player card is discarded, it is placed faceup on top
of the owning player’s discard pile.
• If an encounter card is discarded, it is placed faceup
on top of the encounter discard pile.
• If multiple cards are discarded simultaneously from
a player’s hand or from play, place those cards in the
appropriate discard pile in any order.
• If multiple cards are discarded simultaneously from
a deck, place those cards in the appropriate discard
pile one at a time (without changing the order).

There are eight encounter card types: attachment cards,
environment cards, minion cards, main scheme cards,
obligation cards, side scheme cards, treachery cards, and
villain cards.
• Encounter cards belong to various classifications, such
as scenario-specific encounter cards or modular set
encounter cards.
• Most encounter cards have an orange card back.

DISC ARD PILE

ENCOUNTER DECK

A discard pile is an out-of-play area that contains cards that
have been discarded throughout the game.

The encounter deck contains the encounter cards
(attachments, environments, minions, side schemes, and
treacheries) that players can face during a scenario.

• Each player has their own discard pile, and the
encounter deck has its own discard pile.
• Each discard pile is open information, and may be
looked at by any player at any time.
• The order of cards in a discard pile may not be
changed unless a player is instructed to do so by a
card ability.
• Any ability that would shuffle a discard pile of zero
cards back into a deck does not shuffle the deck.
See also: Discard, In Play and Out of Play, Ownership and
Control, Player, Shuffle

DR AW, DR AWING C ARDS
If a player is instructed to draw one or more cards, those
cards are drawn from the top of their deck.
If a player draws two or more cards as the result of a
single game step or card ability, those cards are drawn
simultaneously.
Drawn cards are added to a player’s hand.
Each player’s hand size is checked at the end of the player
phase. If a player has more cards in their hand than their
hand size value at this time, they must choose and discard
cards from hand until they are at their hand size.

ENCOUNTER C ARD

• The order of cards within the encounter deck cannot
be changed unless a player is instructed to do so by a
game step, game function, or card ability.
If the encounter deck is empty, the encounter discard pile is
immediately shuffled to create a new encounter deck. When
this occurs, place an acceleration token next to the main
scheme deck.
• If a card ability discards a specified number of
cards from the encounter deck or until a card with
specific criteria is discarded, discard cards from the
encounter deck until the discard condition is met or
the encounter deck is empty. If the encounter deck is
emptied this way, that card ability is considered to be
fulfilled. Do not continue the discard effect with the
newly shuffled encounter deck.
• If there are no cards in both the encounter deck and
the encounter discard pile simultaneously (such as
all cards from the encounter deck being in play),
an infinite loop occurs with an infinite number of
acceleration tokens being placed next to the main
scheme deck. If this happens, the players lose.

ENCOUNTER SET
An encounter set is a grouping of encounter cards.
• There are four types of encounter sets: scenariospecific encounter sets, modular encounter sets, the
Standard set, and the Expert set.

Set, Scenario-Specific Card, Standard Set

END OF PL AYER PHA SE

• While a minion is engaged with a player, card abilities
cannot cause the minion to engage with the same
player again (as the two are already engaged).
See also: Ability, Defeat, Minion, Player, Player’s Play Area

To end the player phase, perform the following steps:
1.

In player order, each player may discard any number of
cards from their hand, and must discard down to their
hand size if they have more cards than their hand size.

2.

Each player simultaneously draws up to their hand size.

3.

Each player simultaneously readies all of their cards.

ENTERS PL AY
The phrase “enters play” refers to any time when a card
transitions from an out-of-play area into play. Playing a card,
putting a card into play by using a card ability, or revealing
a card from the encounter deck are all different means by
which a card may enter play.

ENEMY

ENVIRONMENT

An enemy is a minion or villain.

Environment is an encounter card type that creates an
overarching rule or set of rules for the scenario.

When used as a descriptor, “enemy” refers to game
elements that belong to the scenario: “enemy cards”,
“enemy abilities” etc.
See also: Minion, Villain

An environment card enters play in the villain’s play area,
and is active so long as it remains in play.
• If an environment enters play, it remains in play until a
card ability or game effect causes it to leave play.

ENEMY ACTIVATION

Activation)

ENEMY AT TACKS

E VENT
Event is a player card type that is generally played for an
instantaneous effect.

See: Activation, Attack (Enemy Activation)

Each time a player plays an event card, its costs are paid,
its effects resolve (or are canceled), and the card is placed
in its owner’s discard pile after those effects resolve (or are
canceled).

ENEMY SCHEMES
See: Activation, Scheme (Enemy Activation)

ENERGY RESOURCE ()
An energy resource () is one of the four types of resources.
• Energy resources can be spent to pay the resource
cost of cards and abilities.
• Some card abilities specifically require energy
resources to be spent in order to resolve their effects.
See also: Ability, Cost, Icons, Mental Resource, Physical
Resource, Resource, Wild Resource

ENGAGE
After a minion enters play in a player’s play area, it engages
that player.
Unless otherwise specified by the minion or by the effect
that put the minion into play, the minion engages the player
who is resolving the current encounter card.
• An engaged minion remains engaged with the same
player until it is defeated, removed from play, or a
card ability causes it to engage another player.
• If a card ability instructs a player to engage a minion,
that minion is also considered to have engaged that
player.

• If the effects of an event are canceled, the card is still
considered to have been played, and its costs remain
paid. Only the effects are canceled.
• Playing an event card from hand is always optional for
a player, unless the event uses the word “must” in its
play instructions.
• An event card cannot be played unless the resolution
of its effect (ignoring costs) could change the game.
• Event cards are considered to be an extension of an
identity. Attacks, thwarts, defenses, action abilities,
and triggered abilities that resolve from a player
playing an event are also considered to be performed
by that player’s identity.

E XCESS DAMAGE
Excess damage is any amount of damage that is dealt to
a character beyond that character’s remaining hit points.
See also: Ally, Damage, Hit Points, Identity, Minion,
Remaining Hit Points, Villain


E XHAUSTED
If a card is exhausted, it is rotated 90 degrees.
• An exhausted card cannot be exhausted again until it
is ready. Cards are typically readied by a game step
or card ability.
• A card ability on an exhausted card is active and
can still interact with the game state. However, if an
exhausted card must exhaust to pay the cost of using
its ability, that ability cannot be used until the card
is ready.

• The first player has the first opportunity to use
an interrupt at each appropriate game moment.
Interrupt opportunities then proceed among the
remaining players in player order.
• The first player has the first opportunity to use
a response at each appropriate game moment.
Response opportunities then proceed among the
remaining players in player order.

FORCED

E XPERT MODE

Forced is a bold trigger word. If the word “Forced”
precedes a triggered ability, the ability’s initiation is
mandatory.

See: Modes of Play

E XPERT SET
The expert set is an encounter set that is added to scenarios
during expert mode.
• The expert set is not a modular encounter set and
cannot be selected (by the players or randomly) when
a scenario requires players to choose a modular
encounter set to include in that scenario.
• Cards in the “Expert” classification are any cards that
have the word “Expert” printed by the bottom of the
card in its encounter set name area.

• For any given triggering condition, forced interrupts
take priority and initiate before non-forced interrupts,
and forced responses take priority and initiate before
non-forced responses.
• If two or more forced abilities would initiate at the
same moment, the first player determines the order in
which the abilities initiate, regardless of who controls
the cards bearing those abilities.
• Each forced ability must resolve as completely
as possible before the next forced ability being
triggered by the same triggering condition may
initiate.

FIRST PL AYER

FORM, CHANGE FORM

A first player is determined by the players at the beginning
of the game.

A player can be in either hero or alter-ego form at a given
time. This is indicated by the player’s identity card.

The first player token is used to indicate which player is
the first player. At the end of the round (during step five of
the villain phase) the first player token passes to the next
clockwise player, who becomes first player for the next
round.
If the first player is eliminated, the first player token
immediately passes clockwise to the next player.
The players as a group are encouraged to work together,
but the first player decides the following:
• If an encounter card targets a specific player or card,
and there are multiple eligible targets, the first player
selects among the eligible options.
• If an encounter card requires a card ability to be
resolved, a game function to be performed, or a
choice to be made but does not specify which player
should act, the first player does so.
• If two or more effects would resolve simultaneously,
the first player decides the order in which to resolve
them.
The first player has timing priority in the following situations:

• Once each round, during their turn, each player is
permitted to change form by flipping their identity
card.
• When a player changes form, only the form changes.
The character retains their sustained damage, status
cards, lasting effects, attachments, tokens, and
current state (ready or exhausted).
• If a card ability causes a player to change forms,
it does not count against the one voluntary form
change the player is permitted during their turn that
round.
• While a player is in hero form, card abilities that
interact with their alter-ego do not interact with
their identity.
• While a player is in alter-ego form, card abilities
that interact with their hero do not interact with
their identity.
See also: Identity

FRIENDLY
Friendly is a blanket term that refers to cards the players
control.


GAINS

HERO, HERO FORM

If a card gains a characteristic (such as a trait, keyword, or
ability text), the card functions as if it possesses the gained
characteristic. Gained characteristics are not considered to
be printed on the card.

See: Form, Identity

See also: Keywords, Printed, Trait

HEROIC MODE
See: Modes of Play

HINDER X

GENER ATE

When a card with the hinder X keyword is revealed, place
X threat on that card. (X is the value next to the hinder
keyword.)

See: Resource

GETS
If a card ability causes a character to “get” a statistic (such
as +1 ATK or 4 hit points), the ability modifies the character’s
statistic while it is active.

See also: Keywords, Reminder Text, Reveal, Threat

HIT POINTS

• If such an ability expires or otherwise becomes
inactive, the modified statistic reverts to the value it
would have without the modifier.

Each character (identity, ally, minion, and villain) has a
hit point value. Hit points represent the durability of that
character.

• If such an ability causes a character to get hit points,
it modifies the character’s remaining hit points
while the ability remains active, and also modifies
the character’s maximum hit points while the ability
remains active.

When damage is dealt to a character, it reduces the
character’s remaining hit points (the amount of damage that
character can take before reaching zero hit points).

See also: Ally, Hit Points, Identity, Minion, Villain

GUARD
While a minion with the guard keyword is engaged with a
player, that player cannot use cards they control to attack a
villain without this keyword.
See also: Attack (Player Action), Engage, Keywords, Minion,
Reminder Text, Villain

HAND SIZE
Each player checks their hand size at the end of the player
phase, either discarding down to or drawing up to the
number of cards indicated by their hand size value.
See also: End of Player Phase

HA Z ARD ICON ()
During step three of the villain phase, for each hazard
icon on cards in play, deal an additional encounter card.
Additional cards are dealt in player order (first additional
card to the first player, the second to the second player,
etc.).

• An identity’s or villain’s hit point dial represents
their remaining hit points. If an identity or villain
is damaged, apply the damage by reducing that
character’s hit point dial by the specified amount.
• If a player’s hit point dial is reduced to zero, that
player is defeated and eliminated from the game.
• If a villain’s hit point dial is reduced to zero, that stage
of the villain is defeated.
• If an ally or minion is damaged, track the damage by
placing damage tokens on that character. Damage
tokens on an ally or minion reduce that character’s
remaining hit points by the total value of the tokens.
An ally or minion with zero or fewer remaining hit
points is defeated and placed in the appropriate
discard pile.
Some characters may have an infinite number of hit points.
A character with infinite hit points cannot be defeated by
taking damage, as the amount of damage that character
takes will never cause its remaining hit points to reach zero.
However, damage may still be dealt to a character with
infinite hit points through attacks and card abilities.

HE AL
If an ability heals a character, damage the character has
sustained can be removed from the character.
• A heal effect can only bring a character to its
maximum hit points, unless the effect explicitly states
it can bring the character above its maximum.

ICONS
Icons are game elements that represent various functions
within the game.
• Energy Icon (): An energy icon is a resource icon
that generates one energy resource when spent.
(See: Energy Resource)
• Mental Icon (): A mental icon is a resource icon that
generates one mental resource when spent. (See:
Mental Resource)
• Physical Icon (): A physical icon is a resource icon
that generates one physical resource when spent.
(See: Physical Resource)
• Wild Icon (): A wild icon is a resource icon that
can generate one energy, mental, physical, or wild
resource when spent. (See: Wild Resource)
• Acceleration Icon (): An acceleration icon places
additional threat on the main scheme during the
villain phase. (See: Acceleration Icon)
• Amplify Icon (): An amplify icon increases the
number of boost icons on boost cards during enemy
activations by one. (See: Amplify Icon)
• Crisis Icon (): A crisis icon prevents players from
removing threat from the main scheme. (See: Crisis
Icon)
• Hazard Icon (): A hazard icon increases the number
of encounter cards that are dealt to players during the
villain phase. (See: Hazard Icon)
• Boost Icon (): A boost icon increases the activating
enemy’s ATK or SCH value during enemy activations.
(See: Boost)
• Star Icon (): A star icon is used in conjunction with
a card’s stat or boost field to indicate that there is a
mandatory ability in the text box that corresponds to
that field. (See: Star Icon)
• Consequential Damage Icon (): A consequential
damage icon is used in conjunction with an ally’s
ATK field or THW field. After an ally attacks or
thwarts, it takes one consequential damage for
each consequential damage icon in that field. (See:
Consequential Damage)
• Per Player Icon (): A per player icon next to a value
multiplies that value by the number of players who
started the scenario. (See: Per Player Icon)
• Unique Icon (): A unique icon in a card’s title
indicates the card is unique. (See: Unique Icon)

IDENTIT Y
Identity is a player card type that represents which character
a player is playing in the game.
A player’s identity card is a double-sided card that
represents their hero on one side and their alter-ego on the
other. The side that is face up indicates the form (hero or
alter-ego) that player is currently in.

• If a card refers to a hero or alter-ego by title, it refers
only to the identity with that title, and not to the
other side of the card.
• Identity cards cannot be discarded from play.
• The faceup side of an identity card is considered to
be in play. The facedown side of an identity card is
considered to be out of play.
See also: Form, In Play and Out of Play, Player, Player Card

IDENTIT Y-SPECIFIC C ARD
Cards in the “identity-specific” classification (also
sometimes called “hero-specific”) are cards that belong to
an identity’s set of accompanying cards.
• A player’s deck must include each identity-specific
card associated with their chosen identity card. The
exact quantity of each card in that identity-specific set
must be included in the deck.
• Identity-specific cards (along with obligation cards
and nemesis encounter set cards) may only be used
alongside an identity if those cards share a set icon
with that identity.
• An identity-specific card is designated by the
identity’s name with which it is associated printed
at the bottom of the card in its deckbuilding
classification area.
See also: Aspect Card, Basic Card, Classifications, Identity,
Nemesis Encounter Set, Appendix I: Deck Customization

IN PL AY AND OUT OF PL AY
A card is considered to either be in play or out of play
depending on its state within the game.
If a card is in play, its text is active and it can affect the
game.
• For player cards, the faceup side of a player’s identity
card is in play. The faceup ally cards, support cards,
and upgrade cards that have entered play (played,
put into play, etc.) are in play.
• For encounter cards, the faceup side of the top card
of the villain deck and the faceup side of the top
card of the main scheme deck are in play. The faceup
attachment cards, environment cards, minion cards,
obligation cards, and side scheme cards that have
entered play (revealed, put into play, etc.) are in play.
• A card enters play when it moves from an out-of-play
area to a play area.
• Card abilities only interact with, and can only
target, cards that are in play (unless the ability text
specifically refers to an out-of-play area).
• Card abilities on all card types, except event
cards and treachery cards, can only be initiated or
affect the game while they are in play unless they
specifically refer to being used from an out-of-play
area.

• Each player begins the game in alter-ego form.


• If a card is double-sided (having game text on each
side of the card), the faceup side of the card is in play.

• If an enemy’s attack deals indirect damage, the
indirect damage is dealt during step four of the
enemy activation (after player’s have the opportunity
to defend against the attack).

If a card is out of play, its text is inactive and cannot affect
the game.
• Event cards and treachery cards implicitly resolve
from an out-of-play area, by virtue of the rules
pertaining to those card types.
• Cards in a player’s hand, deck, and discard pile are
out of play.
• Cards in the encounter deck, encounter discard pile,
unrevealed cards in the villain deck, unrevealed cards
in the main scheme deck, and facedown encounter
cards dealt to a player are out of play.
• Any cards that have been removed from the game or
that have been set aside are out of play.
• A card leaves play when it moves from a play area to
an out-of-play area.
• If a card is double-sided (having game text on each
side of the card), the facedown side is out of play.

IN PL AYER ORDER
If players are instructed to perform a sequence “in player
order,” the first player performs their part of the sequence
first, followed by the other players in clockwise order.
• If a sequence performed in player order does not
conclude after each player has performed their part
of the sequence once, the sequence of opportunities
continues in a clockwise manner until it is complete.
• The phrase “next player” always refers to the next
(clockwise) player in player order.
See also: First Player, Player, Player Phase, Player Turn

INCITE X
When a card with the incite X keyword is revealed, place X
threat on the main scheme. (X is the value next to the incite
keyword.)
See also: Keywords, Main Scheme, Reminder Text, Reveal,
Threat

INDIRECT DAMAGE
Some card abilities may deal “indirect damage.”
• Indirect damage dealt to a player can be divided as
that player chooses among characters under their
control.
• Indirect damage dealt to a group of players (or
among players) can be divided as the group chooses
among friendly characters in play.
• While assigning indirect damage, a character cannot
be assigned more indirect damage than would cause
it to be defeated. This is assessed without accounting
for interactions with other abilities.

For example, if you take 5 indirect damage, but you control
an ally with 4 hit points remaining, you may assign 4 of
that indirect damage to the ally, then assign the remaining
1 indirect damage to your identity.
See also: Ally, Attack (Enemy Activation), Damage, Defeat,
Player

INFINITE HIT POINTS
See: Hit Points

INITIATING ABILITIES
When a player wishes to play a card or initiate a triggered
ability, that player first declares their intent. Then, the player
checks the following conditions in order:
1.

Check play restrictions: can the card be played, or the
ability initiated, at this time? (This includes verifying
that the resolution of the effect could change the
game.)

2.

Determine the cost (or costs) to play the card or initiate
the ability, taking modifiers into account.

If both conditions are met, follow these steps in order:
3.

Apply any modifiers to the cost(s).

4.

Pay the cost(s). If this step is reached and the cost(s)
cannot be paid, abort this process without paying any
costs.

5.

Make all “choose” decisions required to resolve the
card.

6.

The card commences being played, or the effects of
the ability attempt to initiate.

7.

The card is played or the ability (if not canceled in step
six) resolves. The card enters play or, if it is an event
card, its effects resolve and it is then placed in its
owner’s discard pile.
• If any of the above steps would make the triggering
condition of an interrupt ability true, that ability may
be initiated just before that triggering condition
becomes true.
• If any of the above steps would make the triggering
condition of a response ability true, that ability
may be initiated immediately after that triggering
condition becomes true.
• If the ability being initiated is on a card that is in play,
the sequence does not stop from completing if that
card leaves play during this sequence unless the card
leaving play prevents a required cost from being
paid.

See also: Ability, Cost, Play Restrictions and Permissions

“INSTE AD”
See: Replacement Effect


INTERRUPT
An interrupt ability is a type of triggered ability, indicated
by the bold “Interrupt” timing trigger. Interrupt abilities
may be executed anytime the specified triggering condition
occurs, as described in the interrupt’s ability text. The
interrupt ability interrupts the resolution of the specified
triggering condition, and resolves immediately before that
triggering condition resolves.
• Multiple interrupts may be triggered by the same
triggering condition.
• An interrupt ability is executed when its triggering
condition becomes imminent, but before that
triggering condition resolves. Opportunities to
interrupt occur in player order until all players have
passed consecutively.
• Once all players have consecutively passed on the
opportunity to interrupt an imminent triggering
condition, further interrupts to that specific triggering
condition cannot be used.
• If an interrupt changes (via a replacement effect) or
cancels an imminent triggering condition, further
interrupts to the original triggering condition cannot
be triggered.
See also: Cancel, Replacement Effects, Triggered Ability

KE Y WORDS
A keyword is an attribute that conveys specific rules to its
card. The following keywords are used in the game:
• Guard: While a minion with guard is engaged with
a player, that player cannot attack the villain. (See:
Guard)
• Hinder X: When a player reveals a card with hinder X,
that player places X threat on that card. (See: Hinder
X)
• Incite X: When a player reveals a card with incite X,
that player places X threat on the main scheme. (See:
Incite X)
• Overkill: Excess damage from attacks with overkill
are dealt to the identity or villain. (See: Overkill)
• Patrol: While a minion with patrol is engaged with a
player, that player cannot thwart the main scheme.
(See: Patrol)
• Peril: While a player is resolving a card with peril,
other players cannot help that player. (See: Peril)
• Permanent: Cards with permanent cannot leave play.
(See: Permanent)
• Piercing: Attacks with piercing discard tough status
cards from the target before damage is dealt. (See:
Piercing)
• Quickstrike: After this enemy engages a player, it
immediately attacks that player if they are in hero
form. (See: Quickstrike)
• Ranged: Attacks with ranged ignore retaliate. (See:
Ranged)

18

• Restricted: A player cannot control more than two
restricted cards at a given time. (See: Restricted)
• Retaliate X: After a character with retaliate X is
attacked, deal X damage to the attacker. (See:
Retaliate X)
• Setup: Cards with setup start the game in play. (See:
Setup)
• Stalwart: Characters with Stalwart cannot be stunned
or confused. (See: Stalwart)
• Surge: After a player reveals a card with surge, that
player reveals an additional encounter card. (See:
Surge)
• Team-Up: Cards with team-up cannot be played
unless both characters listed by the keyword are in
play. (See: Team-Up)
• Toughness: When a character with toughness enters
play, place a tough status card on it. (See: Tough/
Toughness)
• Uses (X “type”): When a card with uses enters
play, place X all-purpose counters from the token
pool on that card. After the last all-purpose counter
is removed from a card with uses (and the effect
resolves), discard that card. (See: Uses (X “type”))
• Victory X: When a card with victory X is defeated,
add it to the victory display. (See: Victory X)
• Villainous: When a minion with villainous activates,
give it a boost card. (See: Villainous)

L A STING EFFECTS
Some card abilities create effects or conditions that affect
the game for a specified duration (such as “until the end of
the phase” or “until the end of this attack”). Such effects are
known as lasting effects.
For the specified duration of a lasting effect, treat the effect
as if it was a constant ability.
• A lasting effect persists beyond the resolution of the
ability that created it, for the duration specified by
the effect. The effect continues to affect the game for
the specified duration whether or not the card that
created the lasting effect is in play.
• If a card enters play (or changes status to meet the
criteria of a specified set of affected cards) after the
creation of a lasting effect, it is still affected by that
lasting effect.
• A lasting effect expires as soon as the timing point
specified by its duration is reached. This means that
an “until the end of the round” lasting effect expires
just before an “at the end of the round” ability or
delayed effect may initiate.
• A lasting effect that expires at the end of a specified
time period can only be initiated during that time
period.

LE AVES PL AY

MA X

The phrase “leaves play” refers to any time when a card
transitions from an in-play area to an out-of-play area.
Defeating a character, discarding a card from play, placing
a card in the victory display, or removing a card from the
game are all different means by which a card can leave play.

“Max X per [period]” imposes a maximum across all copies
of a card (by title) for all players. Generally, this phrase
imposes a maximum number of times that copies of that
card can be played during the designated time period.

• When a card leaves play, there is no memory of its
previous state and it is considered to be a new copy
of the card.

If a maximum appears as part of an ability, it imposes a
maximum number of times that the ability can be initiated
from all copies (by title) of cards bearing that ability
(including itself) during the designated period.

See also: Defeat, Discard, Discard Pile, Enters Play, In Play
and Out of Play, Remove from the Game, Victory Display

• If an effect with a maximum is canceled, the card is
still counted toward the maximum.
“Max X per deck” is restricts the number of copies of that
card that may be included in each player deck.

LIMIT
“Limit X per [period]” is a limit that appears on some player
cards. These limits are card-specific. Each copy of an ability
with such a limit may be used X times per the specified
period, per instance of that ability.
• If an effect with a limit is canceled, the card is
still considered to have been played or the ability
initiated, and it counts toward the limit.
See also: Player Card

LOOK, LOOKED-AT
If an ability instructs a player to look at cards that are
otherwise hidden from the players, only the player who is
resolving the ability can look at those cards. However, that
player is permitted to convey any amount of information
related to those cards to other players.

MAIN SCHEME, MAIN SCHEME DECK
Main scheme is an encounter card type. The main scheme
represents the villain’s primary objective.
If the amount of threat on a main scheme is equal to or
greater than its target threat value, the main scheme
deck advances. Remove that scheme from the game, and
advance to the next stage of the main scheme deck.
If the villain completes the final stage of the main
scheme deck, the villain wins the game.
• During step one of the villain phase, place the amount
of threat indicated in the main scheme’s acceleration
field (bottom-right corner) on that scheme. This value
is modified by all active acceleration tokens and icons.
• When the main scheme deck advances, excess threat
from the previous stage does not carry over to the
new stage.
• When the main scheme deck advances, acceleration
tokens on it carry over to the new stage.
• Main scheme cards cannot be discarded from play.
See also: Acceleration, Acceleration Token, Card Types,
Encounter Card, Remove from the Game, Target Threat,

“Max 1 per player” is player specific, and restricts the
number of copies of that card that each player may control
in play at a given time.

MA XIMUM HIT POINTS
A character’s maximum hit points is their base hit points
plus or minus all “gets” hit point modifiers that are active on
that character.

Modifiers, Villain

MAY
The word “may” indicates that a specified player has
the option to resolve the text that follows. If no player is
specified, the option is granted to the controller of the card
with the ability in question.
See also: Player

MENTAL RESOURCE ()
A mental resource () is one of the four types of resources.
• Mental resources can be spent to pay the resource
cost of cards and abilities.
• Some card abilities specifically require mental
resources to be spent in order to resolve their effects.
See also: Ability, Cost, Energy Resource, Icons, Physical
Resource, Resource, Wild Resource

MINION
Minion is an encounter card type. Minions represent
supporters of the villain and/or enemies of the heroes.
If a minion enters play, it engages the player who is
revealing the card from the encounter deck or resolving
the ability that put the minion into play, unless an ability
specifies otherwise.
• If a minion enters play, it remains in play until a card
ability or game effect causes it to leave play.
• If a minion has zero or fewer remaining hit points, it is
defeated and discarded.


• Minions engaged with a player activate (one minion
at a time and in an order of the engaged player’s
choosing) during step two of the villain phase, after
the villain activates. If the engaged player is in hero
form, these minions attack. If the engaged player is in
alter-ego form, these minions scheme.
• If a minion engages a player during an enemy
activation in which all minions engaged with that
player are instructed to activate (such as through a
“Boost” ability during step two of the villain phase),
the newly-engaged minion will also activate.

MODES OF PL AY
Before starting a game of Marvel Champions, players can
customize their experience by choosing from or combining
different modes of play. The modes of play are:
Standard Mode — Standard Mode is the basic mode of
play for all scenarios.
• To play in Standard Mode, follow the content and
setup instructions for the chosen scenario.
Expert Mode — Expert Mode is a modification of standard
mode for advanced players who seek a greater challenge.
• To play a standard game modified by expert mode,
follow the content and setup instructions for the
chosen scenario, using the listed expert mode
villain stages, and add the Expert encounter set to
encounter deck.
• Expert mode can also be combined with heroic
mode, skirmish mode, and/or campaign mode.
Heroic Mode — Heroic mode is a modification of standard
mode that allows players to scale the difficulty of the game.
• To play a standard game modified by heroic mode,
before the game begins, the player group chooses a
heroic level number (such as heroic level 1 or 4). Then,
for the remainder of that game, during step three of
each villain phase, deal X additional encounter cards
to each player, where X is equal to the chosen heroic
level number.
• Heroic mode can also be combined with expert
mode, skirmish mode, and/or campaign mode.
Skirmish Mode — Skirmish mode (also sometimes called
Rookie Mode) is a modification of standard mode that
allows players to shorten the length of the game.
• To play a standard game modified by skirmish mode,
before the game begins, the player group chooses
any one version of the villain. During step eight of
game setup (Select Villain), put only the chosen
version of the villain into play and remove each other
version in the villain deck from the game.

Campaign Mode — Campaign mode allows players to
modify standard mode through interconnected scenarios
that are played one after another. No two campaigns
are exactly alike, and the rules for each are found in the
campaign’s associated rulebook.
• Expert campaign mode is a modification of campaign
mode for advanced players who seek a greater
challenge. The rules for each expert campaign mode
are found in the campaign’s associated rulebook.
• Each campaign comes with its own campaign log.
The campaign log is a record of what effects or cards
persist between games in a campaign.
• If a card is removed from a campaign, that card can
no longer be used during the rest of the campaign,
even if players retry the scenario wherein that card
was removed.
• During campaign mode or expert campaign mode,
players can choose which other mode(s) they wish to
play for each individual scenario. The difficulty of the
campaign mode does not require players to play any
other specific game mode.
• Campaign mode (and expert campaign mode) can
also be combined with expert mode, heroic mode,
and/or skirmish mode.
See also: Campaign-Specific Card, Expert Set, Standard
Set

MODIFIERS
The game constantly checks and (if necessary) updates the
count of any variable quantity that is being modified.
Any time a new modifier is applied or removed, the entire
quantity is recalculated from the start, considering the
unmodified base value and all active modifiers.
• The calculation of a value treats all modifiers as being
applied simultaneously. However, while performing
the calculation, all additive and subtractive modifiers
are calculated before doubling and/or halving
modifiers are calculated.
• If a value is “set” to a specific number, the set
modifier overrides all non-set modifiers. If multiple
set modifiers are in conflict, the most recently
resolved set modifier takes precedence.
• After all active modifiers have been taken into
account, if a value is below zero, it is treated as zero:
a card cannot have “negative” icons, attributes, traits,
cost, or keywords.
• Fractional values are rounded up after all modifiers
have been applied.
See also: Base Value, Printed

• Skirmish mode can also be combined with expert
mode, heroic mode, and/or campaign mode.


MODUL AR ENCOUNTER SET

NON-NUMERIC AL VARIABLE

Cards belonging to a “modular encounter set” (or
sometimes “modular set”) are a classification of encounter
card that can be added to and/or removed from nearly
any scenario.

If a non-numerical variable (such as a letter or other symbol)
is used in place of a numerical value, treat that variable
as being equal to 0 for the purpose of game steps, game
functions, and card abilities.

• During game setup, many scenarios will instruct the
players on how many modular encounter sets must be
included in that scenario. Depending on the scenario,
some modular encounter sets are required, while
others can be chosen by the players.
• If a modular encounter set is added to a scenario, it
is done so as an entire set. Unless specific scenario
rules state otherwise, individual cards from a modular
encounter set cannot be included in a scenario
without the rest of that set.
• A modular encounter set card is designated by
the modular encounter set’s name with which it is
associated printed at the bottom of the card in its
encounter set name area.
See also: Classifications, Appendix I: Deck Customization

MOVE
Some abilities allow players to move game elements, such
as cards, damage, or threat.
• When an element moves, it cannot move to its same
(current) placement.
• If there is no valid source or destination for a move,
the move cannot be made.
• It is possible for damage to move between dials and
cards (and vice versa).
• If damage is moved from a dial to a card, increase the
hit points tracked by the dial by the specified amount
(no higher than the card’s maximum hit points), and
place the same amount of damage on the card.
• If damage is moved from a card to a dial, remove
damage from the card and reduce the dial by the
same amount.
• If damage is moved to a character, the moved
damage is considered to be dealt to that character.
• If threat is moved to a scheme, the moved threat is
considered to be placed to that scheme.

NEMESIS ENCOUNTER SET
Each identity in the game comes with an associated nemesis
encounter set. At the start of the game, each player sets
aside the cards from their associated nemesis set, out of
play. Cards drawn from the encounter deck may instruct the
player on how to bring their nemesis set into play.

If a non-numerical variable is defined to have a numerical
value (such as a card ability assigning a value to ‘X’), treat
that variable as the defined value.
• For costs involving the letter X, the value of X is
defined by card ability or player choice, after which
the amount paid may be modified by effects without
changing the value of X.
See also: Base Value, Dash, Printed, Star Icon

OBLIGATION
Obligation is an encounter card type that represents a
commitment or obstacle that an identities alter-ego might
have to face or overcome.
• Each identity is associated with one or more
obligation cards. If an identity is being played, all
of that identity’s associated obligation cards are
shuffled into the encounter deck during setup.
• Identity-specific obligation cards are part of their
associated identity’s identity-specific set.
• Identity-specific obligation cards can only be used
alongside an identity if those cards share a set icon
with that identity.
If an obligation card is revealed from the encounter deck
and that obligation instructs that it must be given to a
specific player (such as “Give to the Peter Parker player”),
place that obligation into the player’s play area who controls
the associated identity. That player must decide how to
resolve the obligation.
• If the identity associated with a revealed obligation
card has been eliminated, ignore the card’s ability,
remove it from the game, and reveal an additional
encounter card.
If a player reveals an obligation card from the encounter
deck and that obligation does not instruct that it must be
given to a specific player, the player places that obligation
into their play area. That player must decide how to resolve
the obligation.
• Only the player with the obligation in their play-area
can trigger abilities or pay costs on that obligation.

• A nemesis encounter set is a subset of an identityspecific set.
• A nemesis set cards may only be used alongside
an identity if those cards share a set icon with that
identity.

OVERKILL

PATROL

If an ally is dealt any amount of excess damage by an attack
with the overkill keyword, simultaneously deal damage
equal to the excess amount to the identity of the player who
controls the ally.

While a minion with the patrol keyword is engaged with a
player, that player cannot use cards they control to thwart
the main scheme.

If a minion is dealt any amount of excess damage by an
attack with the overkill keyword, simultaneously deal
damage equal to the excess amount to the villain.
• Damage dealt by overkill to an identity or villain does
not constitute an attack against that character.
• If a card ability counts excess damage dealt, that
ability counts the same value of excess damage that
is calculated when resolving the overkill keyword.
See also: Ally, Attack (Enemy Activation), Attack (Player
Action), Damage, Hit Points, Identity, Keywords, Minion,
Reminder Text, Villain

OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL
A card’s owner is the player whose deck contained the card
at the start of the game. The scenario is considered to be
the owner of the encounter deck and each encounter card.
• Cards enter play under their owner’s control.
Encounter cards are considered to be under the
control of the scenario.
• Control of a card remains constant unless an ability
explicitly causes the card to change control.

PER PL AYER ICON ()
The  icon next to a value multiplies that value by the
number of players who started the scenario.
• If a player is eliminated, this value does not change.
See also: Icons, Player Elimination

PERIL
While a player is resolving a card with the peril keyword,
that player cannot consult other players, and other players
cannot play cards or trigger abilities.
See also: Ability, Keywords, Player, Reminder Text, Table
Talk, Triggered Ability

PERMANENT
A card with the permanent keyword cannot leave play.
• If a player is eliminated from the game while a
permanent card they do not own is in their play area,
place that permanent card in its owner’s discard pile.

• A player controls the cards in their own out-of-play
areas (such as the hand, the deck, and the discard
pile).

See also: In Play and Out of Play, Keywords, Leave Play,
Ownership and Control, Reminder Text

• If a card that has changed control leaves play, after
the resolution of the game occurrence that makes it
leave play, the card is physically placed in its owner’s
equivalent out-of-play area (hand, deck, or discard
pile, or removed from the game if that player is no
longer in the game). Other card abilities cannot
interact with this secondary physical placement.

PIERCING

• If a character changes control while it is in play, it
remains in the same state (i.e., readied or exhausted,
damaged or not, etc.) and is moved to its new
controller’s play area.
• Upgrades or attachments on a card that changes
control also change control to the same new
controller.
• Unless a duration is specified, a control change
persists as long as the card remains in play.
• If a game step or card ability references a card that
“you control” or a “player controls,” that game step
or card ability only refers to cards in play currently
under that player’s control.

PHYSIC AL RESOURCE ()
A physical resource () is one of the four types of resources.
• Physical resources can be spent to pay the resource
cost of cards and abilities.
• Some card abilities specifically require physical
resources to be spent in order to resolve their effects.
See also: Ability, Cost, Energy Resource, Icons, Mental
Resource, Resource, Wild Resource

PL AY, PUT INTO PL AY
Playing a card involves paying the card’s cost and placing
the card in the play area. This causes the card to enter play
(or, in the case of an event card, to resolve its ability and be
placed in the discard pile). Cards are played from a player’s
hand.


Some abilities cause cards to be put into play. This bypasses
the need to pay the card’s cost as well as any restrictions or
prohibitions regarding playing that card. A card that is put
into play enters play in its controller’s play area.
• When an event card is played, place it on the table,
resolve its ability, and place the card in its owner’s
discard pile.
• A card that is put into play is not considered to have
been played.
• When a card is put into play, its resource cost is
ignored.
• Unless otherwise stated by the “put into play” effect,
cards that are put into play must do so in a play area
or state that matches the rules of playing the card.
See also: Enters Play, In Play and Out of Play, Leaves Play,
Play Restrictions and Permissions

PL AY ARE A
There are two types of play areas: a player’s play area and
the villain’s play area.
• A player’s play area contains that player’s identity,
deck, hand, discard pile, any cards in play under
their control, and any faceup or facedown encounter
cards in their play area (such as engaged minions or
encounter cards that have been dealt to them).
• The villain’s play area contains the villain deck, main
scheme deck, encounter deck, encounter discard
pile, and any encounter cards in play that have not
entered a player’s play area (such as side schemes or
environments).
• A card cannot be in more than one play area at a
time.
See also: In Play and Out of Play, Player’s Play Area, Villain’s
Play Area

PL AY RESTRICTIONS AND
PERMISSIONS
Many cards and abilities contain specific instructions
pertaining to when or how they may or may not be used,
or to specific conditions that must be true in order to use
them.
• In order to use an ability or play a card, all of its play
restrictions must be observed.
• A permission is an optional play restriction, which
allows a player to play a card or use an ability outside
the timing or specifications provided by the game
rules. For example, a permission might allow an ally
card to be played from a player’s discard pile.
See also: Ability, Play, Player

PL AYER
A player is a person who is playing in a game of Marvel
Champions.
• Each player in the game has their own personal play
area containing their identity card, their identity’s hit
point dial, their hand of cards, their deck that they draw
from, their discard pile that they place their discarded
cards into, any allies, upgrades, or supports that they
may have in play, and any attachments, minions, or
obligations that they may have in their play area.
• During each player phase of each round, each player
takes their own personal turn where they can play
cards, perform actions with cards they control, and
use various abilities.
• Each player owns the cards that were contained
within their deck (including their identity card) at the
start of the game.
• Some game steps, game functions, or card abilities
may refer to the “first player”. The first player is the
player who has the first player token.

PL AYER C ARD
There are six player card types: ally cards, event cards,
identity cards, resource cards, support cards, and upgrade
cards.
• Player cards may belong to various classifications, such
as identity-specific player cards or aspect player cards.
• Most player cards have a blue card back.
See also: Ally, Classifications, Event, Identity, Resource
Cards, Support, Upgrade, Appendix I: Deck Construction

PL AYER DECK
A player’s deck contains the player cards (allies, events,
resources, supports, and upgrades) owned by the player
who started the game with that deck.
• The order of cards within a player’s deck cannot be
changed unless a player is instructed to do so by a
game step, game function, or card ability.
If a player deck empties, the player shuffles their discard
pile to make a new deck. That player immediately deals
themself one facedown encounter card from the top of the
encounter deck.
• If the player’s deck empties and reshuffles while the
player was drawing cards, the player continues to draw
cards up to the specified number.
• If the player’s deck empties while the player was
discarding cards from their deck, no further cards are
discarded from the newly shuffled deck.

Shuffle


PL AYER DISC ARD PILE

• Use an ally card they control in play to attack an
enemy or thwart a scheme.

See: Discard Pile

PL AYER ELIMINATION
A player is eliminated from the game if their identity
is defeated. This usually occurs when the character’s
remaining hit points are reduced to zero.
When a player is eliminated, perform the following in order:
1. If there are minions engaged with the eliminated player,
each of those minions engages the next clockwise
player, retaining any attachments, damage, counters,
and status cards on them.

• Trigger an “Action” card ability on a card in play they
control, on an encounter card in play, or by playing
an event card with such a timing trigger from their
hand. If the action ability is preceded by “Hero” or
“Alter-Ego”, the player must be in the specified form
in order to trigger the ability.
• Ask another player to trigger an “Action” ability on
a card in play they control or on an event card they
might have in hand. The other player then decides
whether or not to trigger the ability. (Another player
may offer to use an action during the active player’s
turn, as well.)

2. If there are cards in the eliminated player’s play area
that are not owned by that player, place each of those
cards in its owner’s discard pile (even if that card has the
permanent keyword).

See also: Ally, Basic Power, Encounter Card, Event, Form,
Ownership and Control, Play, Player, Player Phase, Support,
Triggered Ability, Upgrade

3. Remove the eliminated player’s play area and each other
game element within (hand, deck, discard pile, cards in
play, hit point dial, etc.) from the game.

PL AYER’S PL AY ARE A

When a player is eliminated, the remaining players continue
to play the game. Eliminated players are considered to win
or lose along with the rest of the group, depending on how
they finish.
• If all players are eliminated, the game ends and the
players lose.
If a player is eliminated partway through the resolution of an
ability, resolve the entire ability.

PL AYER PHA SE
During the player phase, each player (in player order) takes
one turn.
After each player has taken a turn, the players discard
down or draw up to their hand size and ready all cards they
control.
See also: End of Player Phase, In Player Order, Player,
Player Turn

PL AYER TURN
During their turn, a player may perform the following
options, in any order. Each option, except “change form,”
may be performed as many times as the player is able, so
long as they are able to pay the required costs.

A player’s play area (also sometimes referred to as a
“player’s game area”) is the area of play where a player’s
identity card, deck, hand, discard pile, and hit point dial are
located. Each player in the game has their own play area.
• Ally cards, support cards, and upgrade cards are
placed in a player’s play area when they enter play.
• Attachment cards attached to cards in the villain’s
play area are not in the player’s play area.
• Minion cards engaged with a player are in that
player’s play area and not in the villain’s play area.
• Obligation cards given to a play are in that player’s
play area and not in the villain’s play area.
• While card abilities can affect cards across play areas,
unless a game rule or card ability states otherwise,
cards cannot be played into another player’s play
area.
• If a player is eliminated from the game (through their
identity being defeated, or otherwise), their play area
is removed from the game.

• Change form from hero to alter-ego, or from alterego to hero. This option may only be performed
once each turn.
• Play an ally, upgrade, or support card from hand.
• Use their alter-ego’s basic recovery (if in alter-ego
form) or their hero’s basic attack or thwart power (if in
hero form).


PRE VENT

REFERENTIAL ABILIT Y

Some card abilities prevent damage or threat.

Some abilities refer to specific cards by name. These are
called referential abilities.

• When damage is prevented, reduce the amount of
damage being dealt before it is applied to the target.
• When threat is prevented, reduce the amount of
threat being assigned before it is placed on the
scheme.
See also: Ability, Damage, Scheme (Card Type), Target,
Threat

PRINTED
The word “printed” refers to the text, characteristic, or value
that is physically printed on the card.
See also: Base Value, Modifiers

QUALIFIERS
If ability text includes a qualifier followed by multiple terms,
the qualifier applies to each item in the list, if applicable.
For example, in the phrase “each ready character and
attachment” the word “ready” applies to both “character”
and “attachment.”

QUICKSTRIKE
After a minion with the quickstrike keyword engages a
player whose identity is in hero form, that minion attacks
that player.
See also: Attack (Enemy Activation), Engage, Form,
Keywords, Minion, Player, Reminder Text

R ANGED
An attack with the ranged keyword ignores the retaliate
keyword.
See also: Attack (Enemy Activation), Attack (Player Action),
Keywords, Reminder Text, Retaliate X

RE ADY
Cards enter play in a ready state, positioned so that their
controller can read their text from left to right.
• If a player is instructed to ready an exhausted card,
the card is returned to its ready state.
See also: Enters Play, Exhausted

REC

• If an ability references the name of the card that
the ability is on, that ability is self-referential. A
self-referential ability refers only to the card on which
it is located and not to other copies of that card or
different cards with the same title.
• If an ability on an identity-specific card references
the name of the identity to which it belongs, it is
referencing only that identity and not other cards that
may share a name with that identity.
• If a non-self-referential, non-identity-specific card
references a card and there are multiple cards in
play with that name, the player resolving that ability
may choose which card with that name becomes the
target of that ability.
See also: Ability, Character, Classifications, Identity,
Identity-Specific Card

REMAINING HIT POINTS
A character’s remaining hit points is the amount of damage
that character can take before reaching zero hit points.
• An identity’s or villain’s hit point dial represents their
remaining hit points.
• To calculate remaining hit points for an ally or minion,
start with the character’s maximum hit points (as
indicated by its printed value modified by any card
abilities or game effects), and subtract their sustained
damage (the number of damage counters on them).
See also: Hit Points, Hit Point Dial, Identity, Sustained
Damage, Villain

REMINDER TE X T
Some card abilities may include reminder text. Reminder
text is italicized and in parentheses (like this). Reminder text
has no effect on the game and is only intended to remind a
player of a specific game function or rule.

REMOVED FROM THE GAME
A card that has been removed from the game is set aside
and does not interact with the game in any manner for the
duration of its removal. If there is no specified duration, a
card that has been removed from the game is considered
removed until the end of the game.
• “Removed from the game” is an out-of-play state.

See: Basic Power, Recover

See also: In Play and Out of Play, Leaves Play

RECOVER
Recover is a basic power a player can use in alter-ego form.
To recover, the player exhausts their alter-ego and heals a
number of hit points equal to their REC value.
See also: Basic Power, Form, Heal, Hit Points, Identity


REPL ACEMENT EFFECT
A replacement effect is an effect that replaces the handling
of one resolution with a different means of handling that
resolution. Most replacement effects are interrupt abilities
in the format of “when [triggering condition] would happen,
do [replacement effect] instead.” After all responses to the
original triggering condition have resolved and it is time
to resolve the triggering condition itself, the replacement
effect resolves instead.
• If multiple replacement effects are initiated against
the same triggering condition, the most recent
replacement effect is the one that is used for the
resolution of the triggering condition.
See also: Ability, Alteration Effect, Triggered Ability

RESOURCE
Resources are used to pay the cost to play cards and to pay
certain ability costs.
• A player can generate resources to pay a cost by
discarding cards from their hand to generate the
resource or resources indicated at the bottom-left
corner of the card, or by using card abilities that
generate resources.
• There are four types of resources in the game:
energy, mental, and physical, and wild. Wild resources
can be used as their type or any of the other types.
• To pay the cost of playing a card, a number of
resources equal to (or greater than) the card’s cost
must be generated. For most cards, any type (or mix
of types) of resources can be used to pay this cost.
• If an ability has a resource cost, a number of
resources equal to or greater than this cost must be
generated. Many abilities require specific resource
types, and the specified types in the specified
quantities must be generated in order to pay the cost
of the ability.
• Excess resources generated toward any cost are lost,
and do not carry over to future costs.

These cards generally provide more (or more efficient)
resources than other card types when they are discarded
from a player’s hand to generate resources.
• Some resource cards have card text that is active
while using the card to generate resources.
• Resource cards are considered to be an extension of an
identity. If a player spends a resource, that resource is
also considered to be spent by that player’s identity.

RESPONSE
A response ability is a type of triggered ability, indicated by
the bold “Response” timing trigger. Response abilities may
be executed after the specified triggering condition occurs,
as described in the response’s ability text.
• Multiple responses may be executed from the same
triggering condition.
• A response opportunity occurs immediately
after its triggering condition has been resolved.
Opportunities to respond occur in player order until
all players have passed consecutively.
• Once the opportunity to respond to a triggering
condition has been passed consecutively by all
players, further responses to that specific triggering
condition cannot be used.

RESTRICTED
A player cannot have more than two cards with the
restricted keyword in play under their control at the same
time. If a player ever controls more than two restricted cards
in play, they must immediately choose and discard from play
restricted cards they control until they have only two in play.

Rules Reference

RE VE AL

SCH

During step four of the villain phase, each player (in player
order) reveals and resolves all facedown encounter cards
that have been dealt to them, one card at a time.

See: Basic Power, Scheme (Enemy Activation)

To reveal an encounter card, a player flips the card faceup
and resolves the card, including any keywords and “When
Revealed” effects. Resolve revealed encounter cards based
on their card type, as follows. If the revealed card is:

The word “scheme” denotes two different card types: main
schemes and side schemes.

SCHEME (C ARD T YPE)
• If a card ability places threat on or removes threat
from “a scheme,” the player resolving that ability
chooses which scheme—main scheme or side
schemes—that ability affects.

• an attachment, it enters play attached to the element
specified by its text.
• a minion, it enters play engaged with the player
revealing the card.

See also: Main Scheme, Side Scheme

• a treachery, its effects resolve and it is discarded.

SCHEME (ENEMY ACTIVATION)

• an environment, it enters play next to the villain.
• a side scheme, it enters play next to the main scheme.
• an obligation, it is given to the player specified by
the card, and that player resolves its text.
If a player is instructed by card text to reveal an encounter
card from the encounter deck or any other game area, this
same resolution procedure applies.

A scheme is a type of enemy activation. If an enemy is
instructed to scheme, follow these steps:
1.

If a villain, or a minion with the villainous keyword, is
scheming, give it one facedown boost card from the
encounter deck. (If a minion without the villainous
keyword is scheming, skip this step.)

2.

Flip each of the scheming enemy’s boost cards faceup
one at a time. (If a minion without the villainous
keyword is scheming, skip this step.) Then, in order:

SE ARCH

See: Encounter Deck, Player Deck

When a player is instructed to search for a card, the player is
permitted to look at each of the cards in the searched area.

SCENARIO-SPECIFIC C ARD
Cards in the “scenario-specific” classification are cards that
belong to a scenario’s set of accompanying cards.
• A scenario must include each scenario-specific card
associated with that scenario. The exact quantity of
each card in that set is determined by the scenario.
• In most scenarios, the scenario-specific cards
are separated into three decks: the villain deck
(comprised of that scenario’s villain cards), the main
scheme deck (comprised of that scenario’s main
scheme cards), and the encounter deck (comprised of
that scenario’s attachment, environment, minion, side
scheme, and treachery cards).

If the player finds a card that satisfies the criteria of the
search, the player adds that card to the game area indicated
by the instructions on the search effect.
• If a player finds multiple cards that satisfy the criteria
of a search, the player chooses among those options.
• Cards being searched are not considered to leave the
searched area.
• If any portion of a deck is searched, upon completion
of that game step, game function, or card ability,
shuffle that entire deck.
See also: Encounter Deck, Player Deck, Shuffle

• A scenario-specific card is designated by the name of
the scenario with which it is associated printed at the
bottom of the card in its encounter set name area.

SHUFFLE
Shuffling is the game function of randomizing the contents
of a deck.
• If a player is instructed to shuffle a deck, that deck
must be randomized to the point where no player
within the game can ascertain the order of the cards
within that deck.
• Any time a deck is searched by a game step or card
ability, that deck is shuffled after the game step or
card ability completes its resolution.

SIDE SCHEME
Side scheme is an encounter card type that represents
additional obstacles and distractions the heroes are
confronted with.

STUN, STUNNED
Stun is a status that prevents a character from dealing
damage with its next attack.
• If an ability “stuns” a character, give that character a
stunned status card.
• If a character has an ability stating that it “cannot be
stunned,” stunned status cards cannot be placed on
that character.

Status card represent different states a character may find
themselves in during the game.

See also: Ally, Identity, Minion, Status Cards, Villain

The following status cards are used in the game. When a
character is given a status card, take a status card of the
specified type from the pool and place it on that character.

SUBTITLE

• A character cannot have more than one status card of
each type at a time.
• Status card abilities have timing priority over all
conflicting card abilities.
The three status card types are:
Confused — A confused status card prevents a character
from thwarting or scheming.
• If a confused hero or ally attempts to thwart or use
a thwart ability, discard the confused card instead.
Costs associated with the thwart attempt, including
exhausting the character, must still be paid.
• If a confused villain or minion would scheme, discard
the confused status card instead.
• As the thwart action or scheme activation was
replaced by the removal of the confused status card,
that character is not considered to have thwarted or
schemed.
Stunned — A stunned status card prevents a character
from attacking.
• If a stunned hero or ally attempts to attack or use
an attack ability, discard the stunned card instead.
Costs associated with the attack attempt, including
exhausting the character, must still be paid.
• If a stunned villain or minion would attack, discard the
stunned status card instead.
• As the attack action or attack activation was replaced
by the removal of the stunned status card, that
character is not considered to have attacked.

Some ally cards have a subtitle beneath the title. A subtitle
represents an alternate alias a character sometimes uses.
See also: Unique

SUPPORT
Support is a player card type that represent locations,
backline supporters or friends, and other behind-the-scenes
elements a hero or alter-ego might have at their disposal.
• Support cards enter play in the back row of a player’s
play area.
• A support card is active while it is in play, and it
remains in play until a card ability causes it to leave
play.
• Attacks, thwarts, defenses, action abilities, and
triggered abilities that resolve from supports in play
under a player’s control are not considered to be
performed by that player’s identity.

SURGE
After an encounter card with this keyword is revealed, the
player resolving the card reveals an additional encounter
card from the top of the encounter deck.
• Complete the process of resolving the original card
before revealing the additional card.
See also: Encounter Card, Encounter Deck, Keywords,
Reminder Text, Reveal

Tough — A tough status card prevents a character from
taking damage.
• If a character with a tough status card would take any
amount of damage, prevent all of that damage and
discard the tough status card instead.


SUSTAINED DAMAGE

TE X T BOX

Sustained damage refers to the difference between a
character’s maximum hit points and remaining hit points.

The text box of a card is the area of a card that contains the
card’s printed abilities, traits, and flavor text (if any).

• To calculate sustained damage for an identity or
villain (using a hit point dial), start with the character’s
maximum hit points (as indicated by its printed value
modified by any card abilities or game effects), and
subtract their remaining hit points (as indicated by the
dial).
• Sustained damage on an ally or minion is equal to the
total value of all damage tokens on the card.
See also: Ally, Damage, Hit Points, Identity, Maximum Hit
Points, Remaining Hit Points, Villain

TABLE TALK
Players are permitted and encouraged to talk to one
another during play, and to work as a team to plan and
execute the best course of action. Players can discuss
anything they would like, including cards in play and cards
in their hand. Players are not obligated to disclose the cards
in their hand if they do not wish to do so.
• While resolving an encounter card with the peril
keyword, players are not permitted to consult with
one another.
See also: Keywords, Peril, Player

• If a card ability references a card’s “text box,” that
ability only references the printed abilities within that
card’s text box.
See also: Ability, Printed, Traits, Appendix III: Card
Anatomy

THEN
If the effect text of an ability includes the word “then”,
the text preceding the word “then” must be fully true or
resolved before the remainder of the effect described after
the word “then” can be resolved.
• If the pre-”then” text of an effect fully resolves,
the post-”then” text of the effect must also
attempt to resolve.
• If the pre-”then” text of an effect does not fully
resolve, the post-”then” text does not attempt to
resolve.

THRE AT
Threat tokens are used to track the amount
of threat on scheme cards.
See also: Component Limitations, Scheme
(Enemy Activation), Main Scheme, Side
Scheme, Prevent, Thwart

TARGET
If a game function or card ability is directed toward a game
element (such as an attack that deals damage to an enemy),
that game element becomes the target of that function
or ability for the duration of that function’s or ability’s
resolution.
• The term “choose” indicates that one or more targets
must be selected in order for an ability to resolve.
See also: Ability, Choose

TARGET THRE AT
Target threat is the amount of threat required for the main
scheme deck to advance. It is located in the upper left
corner of the card, before the title.
See also: Main Scheme, Threat

TE AM-UP
The team-up keyword names two characters. In order for a
player to include a card with the team-up keyword in their
deck, that player’s chosen identity must match one of the
named characters. Additionally, a card with the team-up
keyword cannot be played unless both of the named
characters (hero or ally) are in play.
See also: Ally, Identity, In Play and Out of Play, Keywords,
Play, Reminder Text, Appendix I: Deck Construction

THW
See: Basic Power, Thwart

THWART
Some game effects and card abilities reference a thwart
attempt. There are a few different ways this can occur:
• A hero can use their basic thwart power to thwart a
scheme. A hero must exhaust to use this power. This
removes threat equal to the hero’s THW value from
the scheme.
• An ally can use its basic thwart power to thwart a
scheme. This removes threat equal to the ally’s THW
value from the scheme.
• If a triggered ability is labeled as a thwart—such
as “Hero Action (thwart)”—resolving that ability is
considered to thwart the specified scheme. Unless
specified by the ability’s text, a hero does not exhaust
when using such an ability.

Exhausted, Main Scheme, Side Scheme, Threat

TOUGH
Tough is a status that prevents a character from taking

See also: Ally, Enters Play, Identity, Keywords, Minion,
Reminder Text, Status Cards, Villain

UNIQUE ICON ()
A card with a  icon before its title is unique.

TR AITS

• The players as a group are permitted to have only
one copy of each unique card (by title) in play.

Many cards have one or more traits listed at the top of the
text box and printed in bold italics.

• A player cannot include more than one copy of each
unique card (by title) in their deck. The identity card is
included in this evaluation.

• Traits have no inherent effects on the game. Instead,
some card abilities reference cards that possess or
lack specific traits.
• Traits are not considered to be part of a card’s
printed text box for the purpose of card abilities.
See also: Printed, Appendix III: Card Anatomy

TRE ACHERY
Treachery is an encounter card type that represent tactics,
tricks, disasters, and other immediate occurrences that
confront players during a scenario.
• If a treachery card is revealed from the encounter
deck, the player revealing the card must resolve its
effects.
• After resolving the effects of a treachery card (or the
effects are canceled), place the card in the encounter
discard pile.

Deck, Reveal, Villain

TRIGGERED ABILIT Y
See: Ability, Action, Forced, Interrupt, Resource Ability,
Response, Simultaneous Resolution, Special, When
Defeated Abilities, When Revealed Abilities

TRIGGERING CONDITION
A triggering condition is a specific occurrence that takes
place in the game. On card abilities, the triggering
condition is the element of the ability that references
such an occurrence, indicating the timing point at which
the ability may be used. The description of an ability’s
triggering condition usually follows the word “when” or
“after.”
• If a single game occurrence creates multiple
triggering conditions (such as a single attack causing
a character to both take damage and be defeated),
those triggering conditions are handled with a single
interrupt window and a single response window.
During each of these windows, abilities that refer
to any of the triggering conditions created by the
occurrence may be used in any order.
See also: Interrupt, Response

In the Marvel setting, it is possible for multiple people to
bear the same title. (For example, more than one person can
bear the title of “Captain America”, but there is only one
Steve Rogers.) Because of this, a comparison of alter-egos
and/or subtitles between two cards may create the following
exceptions to the unique rules stated above:
• If two identities share the same title, but each has a
different alter-ego, they may coexist in play.
• If two unique allies share the same title, but each
has a different subtitle, they may coexist in a player’s
deck and in play.
• If a hero and a unique ally share the same title, but
the alter-ego and the subtitle are different, they may
coexist in deckbuilding and in play.
Additionally, some unique minions may have the same title
as other friendly or enemy characters.
• If a unique minion is revealed from the encounter
deck and attempts to enter play while another unique
character with the same title is already in play, the
player who is revealing that minion discards it, then
reveals a new card from the encounter deck.
• If a card ability attempts to put a unique minion into
play while another unique character with the same
title is already in play, that minion cannot enter play
and the “put into play” effect fails to resolve. Resolve
the remainder of the card ability as normal.
See also: Ally, Enters Play, Identity, Minion, Player, Subtitle,
Villain, Appendix I: Deck Customization

UPGR ADE
Upgrade is a player card type that represents powers,
attacks, equipment, and other assets that are (in most cases)
at an identity’s immediate disposal.
• An upgrade is active so long as it is in play, and it
remains in play until a card ability causes it to leave
play.
• Most upgrade cards enter play near a player’s identity
card, and modify the player’s hero or alter-ego (or
both).
• Some upgrades enter play and “attach to” another
card. These upgrades modify the card they are
attached to, not the hero or alter-ego of the player
who played the upgrade.


• Unless attached to a different character, upgrade
cards are considered to be an extension of the
controlling player’s identity. Attacks, thwarts,
defenses, action abilities, and triggered abilities that
resolve on upgrades in play under a player’s control
are also considered to be resolved by that player’s
identity.

If the villain’s hit point dial is reduced to zero, the players
have defeated that stage of the villain.
Remove the current stage of the villain deck from the game.
The next sequential stage of the villain deck is revealed. Set
the villain’s hit point dial as indicated by that stage.
If the final stage of the villain deck is defeated, the
players win the game.
• Excess damage that is dealt to defeat a villain stage
does not carry over to the new stage.

USES (X “T YPE”)
When a card with this keyword enters play, place X allpurpose counters from the token pool on the card. The
word following the value establishes and identifies the type
of uses the card holds.

• Attachments, status cards, counters, and nondamage tokens on a villain carry over to the new
stage.

VILL AIN, VILL AIN DECK
Villain is an encounter card type that represents the primary
enemy the players are attempting to defeat in a scenario.
The villain is represented by a sequential deck of one or
more cards. The players defeat the villain by reducing the
hit points of each stage of the villain deck to zero.
• Villain cards cannot be discarded from play.

VILL AIN’S PL AY ARE A
The villain’s play area (also sometimes referred to as the
“villain’s game area”) is the area of play where the villain
deck, the main scheme deck, the encounter deck, the
encounter discard pile, and the villain’s hit point dial are
located.
• Environment cards and side scheme cards are placed
in the villain’s play area when they enter play.
• Attachments cards attached to cards in the villain’s
play area are in the villain’s play area. Attachment
cards attached to cards in a player’s play area are not
in the villain’s play area.
• Minion cards engaged with a player are in that
player’s play area and not in the villain’s play area.
• Obligation cards given to a player are in that player’s
play area and not in the villain’s play area.

VILL AINOUS
When a minion with the villainous keyword activates, give it
a facedown boost card from the top of the encounter deck.
When you resolve that minion’s activation, turn the boost
card faceup, resolve any boost ability on that card, and
apply its boost icons to the minion’s stats for this activation.
Discard the boost card after the activation.

WHEN RE VE ALED ABILITIES
A when revealed ability is a type of triggered ability,
indicated by the bold “When Revealed” timing trigger.

• If an encounter card with a “When Revealed” ability
enters play during setup, resolve that ability during
setup step 10.
• If an encounter card with a “When Revealed” ability
is put into play without being revealed, the “When
Revealed” ability does not trigger.

WILD RESOURCE ()
A wild resource () is one of the four types of resources.
• Wild resources can be spent to pay the resource cost
of cards and abilities. When a player generates a wild
resource (), they may specify which resource type
(energy, mental, physical, or wild) it is being used as.
• Some card abilities specifically require wild resources
to be spent in order to resolve their effects.
• When resources are not being generated for a cost, a
wild resource does not have any characteristic other
than “wild resource.” In such contexts, wild resources
cannot be interpreted as any of the other resource
types.
See also: Ability, Cost, Energy Resource, Icons, Mental
Resource, Physical Resource, Resource

WINNING THE GAME
If the players defeat the final villain stage, they win the
game. If the final stage of the main scheme deck is
completed, the villain wins the game.
• Some scenarios may have alternate win or loss
conditions. If these conditions are met, the players
win or lose accordingly.

“WOULD”
The word “would” is used to define the triggering condition
of some interrupt abilities, and establishes a higher timing
priority for those abilities than interrupts to the same
triggering condition without the word “would.”
• If an interrupt to a triggering condition that would
occur changes the nature of that which is about to
occur (such as through a replacement effect), no
further interrupts to the original trigger may be used
since the resolution of that trigger is no longer valid.
For example, an interrupt that states “when a character
would be defeated” triggers before an interrupt that states
“when a character is defeated.”

“X” (VALUE)
See: Non-Numerical Variable

When a player reveals a card from the encounter deck,
a new scheme stage, or a new villain stage, all “When
Revealed” abilities on the card resolve.


YOU, YOUR
While resolving card abilities, if the word “you” can be
resolved as referring to the player’s identity, it must be
resolved as such. This includes but is not limited to:
• If a card deals damage to “you,” or “you” take damage,
the player resolving that damage applies it to the hit
point dial of their identity.
• If a card ability deals indirect damage to “you,” or
“you” take indirect damage, the player resolving that
damage can assign that damage to characters in play
under their control.
• If a card ability exhausts “you,” the player resolving that
card ability exhausts their identity.
• If a card ability places a status card on “you” (such
as “you are stunned”), the player resolving that card
ability places that status card on their identity.
• If a card ability triggers from a game function that
“you” perform (such as “after you attack and defeat
an enemy”), the player resolving that card ability must
resolve that card ability as if the identity they control
performed that game function, if able. (For example,
if an ability triggers “after you attack and defeat a
minion,” it triggers after the controlling player’s identity
attacks and defeats a minion but not when an ally under
that player’s control attacks and defeats a minion.)
While resolving card abilities, if the word “you” cannot
be resolved as referring to the player’s identity, it must be
resolved as referring to the player. This includes but is not
limited to:

Cards that are considered to be an extension of a player’s
identity are:
• Events — Attacks, thwarts, defenses, action abilities,
and triggered abilities that resolve from a player
playing an event are also considered to be performed
by that player’s identity.
• Resources — If a player spends a resource, that
resource is also considered to be spent by that player’s
identity.
• Upgrades — Unless attached to a different character,
upgrade cards are considered to be an extension
of the controlling player’s identity. Attacks, thwarts,
defenses, action abilities, and triggered abilities that
resolve on upgrades in play under a player’s control
are also considered to be resolved by that player’s
identity.
Cards that are not considered to be an extension of a
player’s identity are:
• Allies — Attacks, thwarts, defenses, action abilities,
and triggered abilities that resolve from allies in play
under a player’s control are not considered to be
performed by that player’s identity.
• Supports — Attacks, thwarts, defenses, action
abilities, and triggered abilities that resolve from
supports in play under a player’s control are not
considered to be performed by that player’s identity.
See also: Ability, Ally, Event, Identity, Player, Player Card,
Player Deck, Player’s Play Area, Resource, Support, Upgrade

• If a game step or card ability discards cards from
“your” hand, the player resolving that game step or
card ability discards the cards from their hand.
• If a card ability searches “your” deck, the player
resolving that ability searches for cards in their deck.
• If a game step or card ability performs a game function
against a non-identity card “you” control (such as
exhausting, discarding, setting aside, etc.), the player
resolving that game step or card ability performs that
game function against the card in their play area.
• If a card ability triggers from a game function that
“you” perform and cannot be interpreted in such a way
that would refer to the resolving player’s identity (such
as “after you discard cards from your hand”), the player
resolving that card ability must personally resolve and
perform the game function(s) of that ability.
Some player cards are considered to be an extension of a
player’s identity. When an action and/or ability is resolved
by a card type that is an extension of an identity, that
action and/or ability is considered to be performed by
that identity.


APPENDIX I: DECK
CUSTOMIZATION

APPENDIX II:
SETUP
To set up a game, perform the following steps in order:

PL AYER DECKS

1.

Select Identities. Each player selects one identity,
placing their alter-ego side face up.

• A player must choose exactly one identity card.

2.

• A player’s deck consists of a minimum of 40 cards
and a maximum of 50 cards. The identity card is not
counted as part of this number.

Set Hit Points. Each player sets their hit point dial
equal to the starting hit points of their character, found
at the bottom of their identity card.

3.

Select First Player. As a group, the players select a
first player and place the first player token in front of
that player.

4.

Set Aside Obligations. For each identity being
played, set aside their obligation card.

5.

Set Aside Nemesis Sets. For each identity being
played, set aside their nemesis and the encounter cards
of that nemesis.

6.

Shuffle Player Decks. Each player shuffles their player
deck.

7.

Collect Tokens and Status Cards. Collect a pool of
damage tokens, threat tokens, acceleration tokens, and
all-purpose counters within reach of each player. Place
stacks of stunned, confused, and tough status cards
near this pool.

8.

Select Villain. Select a villain and put their villain deck
and main scheme deck into play near the center of the
play area.

9.

Set the Villain’s Hit Points. Set the villain’s hit point
dial to the value indicated by the villain card.

The deck customization rules for player decks are:

• A player’s deck must include each of the identityspecific cards associated with their chosen identity
card. The exact quantity of each card included in that
identity set must be included in the deck.
• A player may choose exactly one aspect (Justice,
Aggression, Protection, or Leadership) to use for
customization. The remainder of their deck is then
customized with cards that belong to that aspect and/
or basic cards.
• No more than three copies (by title) of each nonunique card may be included in the deck.
• No more than one copy (by title) of each unique card
may be included among the cards in the deck and the
identity card. If two unique cards share the same title,
but their subtitles/alter-egos differ, they may coexist
in the deck.
• Any “deckbuilding requirements” on the player’s
identity card must be followed.

ENCOUNTER DECKS
Each scenario comes with a recommended list of card sets
that form the default encounter deck for that scenario. (For
the core set scenarios, these lists are on page 23 of the
Learn to Play.) This recommended list can be modified in a
few different ways:
• Expert mode is an option that can be used to
increase the difficulty of a scenario. Expert mode uses
a different combination of villain stages and adds the
expert encounter set to the encounter deck.
• Most scenarios (including all of the scenarios in the
core set) include a modular encounter set within their
recommended list. To customize a scenario for a
different experience, remove the modular encounter
set from the list, and add any other modular
encounter set as desired.
• It is possible to add multiple modular sets to a
scenario, but this will dilute the encounter deck if too
many are added.
• To add an additional element of uncertainty to a
scenario, the modular set may be chosen from a
group of facedown sets, and shuffled directly into the
encounter deck without looking at the cards.

10. Create the Encounter Deck. Combine the encounter
sets listed on side 1A of the main scheme card.
11. Resolve Scheme Setup. Resolve any “Setup”
instructions on side 1A of the main scheme card.
Resolve any “When Revealed” abilities on encounter
cards that entered play during setup.
12. Shuffle Encounter Deck. Shuffle the obligation
cards set aside during setup step four into the villain’s
encounter deck.
13. Draw Cards. Each player draws cards from their deck
until they have cards equal in number to their starting
hand size, as listed near the bottom of their identity
card.
14. Resolve Mulligans. Each player may discard any
number of cards from hand, and then draw up to their
starting hand size. (Do not shuffle these discarded
cards back into their decks at this time.)
15. Resolve Character Setup Abilities. Resolve any
“Setup” instructions listed on identity cards in play.
The game is now ready to begin.

APPENDIX IV: FAQ
GENERAL QUESTIONS

Q: In the Core Set, there are 19 Aggression, Justice, and
Protection aspect cards, but only 18 Leadership aspect
cards. Is this correct?
A: Yes. The Leadership aspect received 1 fewer card than
the other aspects because it has more unique cards to
choose from.

CORE SET

Q: Can Repulsor Blast’s first point of damage remove
a tough status card from an enemy, then its additional
damage deal damage to that enemy?
A: No. The additional damage that Repulsor Blast deals is a
simultaneous modification of its first point of damage. For
instance, if a player were to discard 2 energy resources due
to Repulsor Blast, they would deal a total of 5 damage to an
enemy all at once, as the additional 4 damage dealt by the
discard effect happens at the same time as the first point of
damage.

PEPPER POTTS (#33)

SPIDER-MAN (#1A)

Q: When does the villain “initiate” an attack against
Spider-Man?
A: An attack is “initiated” the moment the game determines
an attack will be made against a character. This includes
attacks made from game steps (such as step 2 of the villain
phase) and card abilities (such as an attack initiated by the
“Assault” treachery). Spider Man’s ability resolves before
any of the steps of the process detailed in the “Attack
(Enemy Activation)” section are performed.

WEBBED UP (#9)

Q: How many attacks does Webbed Up prevent?
A: Two attacks in total. Webbed Up prevents the attached
enemy’s very next attack by replacing that attack with the
placement of a stun status card. Then, the stun status card
will prevent that enemy’s following attack.
Q: Does Webbed Up prevent Spider-Sense from
triggering?
A: Yes. Webbed Up’s ability is a replacement effect
(indicated by the word “instead”), meaning the attack never
initiates.

Q: Does Pepper Potts generate 2 resources if a card with
2 printed resources (such as Energy, Genius, or Strength)
is on top of the discard pile?
A: Yes. Pepper Potts generates a number of resources that
are equal in quantity and type to the resources on the top
card of the discard pile.
Q: Will Pepper Potts generate 2 resources if a “The
Power of [Aspect]” resource card (such as The Power of
Aggression) is on top of the discard pile?
A: No. Though the resources that Pepper Potts generates
are equal in quantity and type to the resources of the top
card of the discard pile, Pepper Potts is the card that is
generating these resources. This means that a The Power
of [Aspect] card never generates resources itself, having no
opportunity to generate additional resources for a card of
its specified aspect.
Q: Can Pepper Potts generate the resources of a card
that is currently being spent?
A: No. Resources are generated simultaneously, meaning
the spent card will not be on top of the discard pile at the
time Pepper Potts uses her ability.

ROCKET BOOTS (#39)

JENNIFER WALTERS (#19B)

Q: Can Jennifer Walters remove threat from a side
scheme as it enters play?
A: No. Side schemes enter play with threat already on them,
meaning threat is not “placed” at this point.
Q: If threat is placed on a scheme during game setup,
does Jennifer Walters’s ability trigger?
A: No. Abilities that do not have the “Setup” timing trigger
cannot resolve during game setup.

LEGAL PRACTICE (#23)

REPULSOR BLAST (#31)

Q: Can Legal Practice remove threat from multiple
schemes simultaneously?
A: No. All of the threat removed by Legal Practice must be
removed from a single scheme.

Q: If Iron Man has 1 hit point remaining and his Rocket
Boots upgrade is discarded from play, is Iron Man
defeated?
A: Yes. If an ability that modifies hit points expires or
otherwise becomes inactive, the modified hit points revert
to the value they would be without the modifier. In this
case, Iron Man’s hit points would revert to 0, instantly
defeating him.

BLACK PANTHER (#40A)

Q: If an enemy initiates an attack against Black Panther
but another hero or an ally defends against that attack,
will Black Panther’s retaliate ability trigger?
A: No. Black Panther himself must be attacked for retaliate
to trigger.
Q: If Black Panther defends against an attack, will his
retaliate ability trigger?
A: Yes. As long as Black Panther himself is attacked, retaliate
will trigger.

40

Rules Reference

ANCESTRAL KNOWLEDGE (#42)

Q: Can Ancestral Knowledge shuffle different versions
of Wakanda Forever into Black Panther’s deck?
A: No. Cards with the same title are considered to be the
same card for the purpose of card abilities.

VIBRANIUM SUIT (#49)

Q: Does moving damage discard tough status cards from
the target enemy?
A: Yes. If damage is moved to a character, the moved
damage is considered to be dealt to that character.

TIGRA/GREER GRANT NELSON (#51)

Q: Does Tigra’s “Response” ability trigger before or
after she takes consequential damage?
A: Before. The “After Tigra attacks and defeats a minion...”
condition is checked immediately after Tigra defeats a
minion with her attack power, but before consequential
damage is applied to her.

MAKE THE CALL (#71)

Q: When playing Make the Call, do “The Power
of [Aspect]” resource cards (such as The Power of
Leadership) generate 1 resource or 2 resources?
A: Make the Call’s text states “Action: Pay the printed
cost of an ally in any player’s discard pile...”, meaning the
player is paying the cost of the ally itself. If that ally’s aspect
matches that of The Power of [Aspect] card, then The Power
of [Aspect] card will generate 2 resources. However, if that
ally’s aspect does not match, The Power of [Aspect] card will
only generate 1 resource.

I SEE YOU (#30)

Q: If I’m in alter-ego form and I reveal “I See You”, does
Green Goblin attack me?
A: Yes. Because the “When Revealed” ability on I See You
does not specify hero form or alter-ego form, Green Goblin
will attack the player no matter their form.

C APTAIN AMERIC A HERO PACK
STEVE ROGERS (#1B)

Q: If Captain America’s Shield is put into play as a Drone
minion during game setup for Ultron, can I retrieve it
with Steve Rogers’s Setup ability?
A: No. The Setup ability specifically searches the player’s
deck and discard pile. If Captain America’s Shield is not in
either game area, the ability fails to find it.
Q: If an ally is played while I’m Captain America, then I
change form to Steve Rogers, will Steve Rogers’s “Living
Legend” ability still apply to the next ally played?
A: No. Living Legend only applies to the very first ally
played each round.

MS. MARVEL HERO PACK
EMBIGGEN (#10)

GREEN GOBLIN SCENARIO PACK

Q: If an Attack event deals multiple sources of damage
(such as the Aggression event, Melee), how does
Embiggen work?
A: Embiggen increases all instances of damage that an
Attack event deals by 2. For example, if an event were to deal
3 damage, then deal 3 damage again, that event would now
deal 5 damage, then 5 damage again.

NORMAN OSBORN (#1A)

SHRINK (#11)

GREEN GOBLIN (#1B)

NOVA/SAM ALEXANDER (#12)

Q: Will a stun status card prevent Norman Osborn’s
attack activation?
A: Yes. Because status cards take priority over all other
abilities, a stun status card will prevent Norman Osborn’s
activation.
Q: While Green Goblin is attacking, if the last madness
counter is removed from the State of Madness
environment through a “Boost” ability, what happens?
A: Green Goblin immediate flips to Norman Osborn form.
Boost icons from the boost card are then added to Norman
Osborn’s ATK value of , which is treated as a value of 0.
Norman Osborn then deals damage from the attack equal
to his modified ATK value (base of 0 ATK, plus the number
of boost icons on the boost card). In this specific situation,
Norman Osborn’s “Forced Interrupt” does not trigger,
as the attack is already past the point of “When Norman
Osborn would attack...” by the time he changes to his
Norman Osborn form.

Q: When playing Emergency, can I exhaust Shrink to
remove 2 threat from a scheme?
A: No. Shrink increases each instance of threat removed by
a thwart event. Because Emergency only prevents threat
and does not remove any, Shrink will have no effect.
Q: If Nova’s ability defeats an attacking enemy, does
that enemy’s attack still deal damage?
A: No. Although the attack sequence has initiated, damage
from that attack has not yet been calculated. If Nova defeats
the enemy during this step, the rest of the attack sequence
fails to resolve.

MELEE (#30)

Q: Can Melee deal damage to the same enemy twice?
A: No. When Melee deals damage a second time, that
damage must be dealt to an enemy that is different from the
first. Note that different stages of the villain are considered
to be the same enemy.
Q: If I’m engaged with a minion with guard, can I target
that minion and the villain, as long as the minion would
be destroyed by the damage done by Melee?
A: Yes, as long as you defeat the minion with the first
sentence of the ability on Melee, you may deal damage to
the villain with the second sentence of the ability.

THOR HERO PACK

IMAGES OF IKONN (#33)

JARNBJORN (#19)

Q: Can I trigger Jarnbjorn after I play an Attack event?
A: Yes. A hero is considered to make an attack both through
their basic attack power and actions with the (attack) label.

BL ACK WIDOW HERO PACK
DANCE OF DEATH (#4)

Q: Dance of Death does not contain the (attack)
label. Are each of its damage-dealing effects actually
considered attacks or is this a mistake?
A: The first sentence of Dance of Death’s ability defines
each damage-dealing effect from Dance of Death as an
individual attack. Resolve each as a normal attack, one at
a time.
Q: If Black Widow is stunned, will each attack from
Dance of Death be prevented, or just the first attack?
A: Because Dance of Death creates three separate attacks,
a stun status card on Black Widow will only prevent the first
attack. The second and third attack can be performed as
normal.

ATTACROBATICS (#6)

Q: Can Attacrobatics cancel 0 boost icons?
A: No. Attacrobatics cannot be used to cancel the boost
icons on a card that has none as doing as would not change
the game state.

WIDOWS BITE (#10)

Q: If I have Widow’s Bite in play and I reveal a minion
with quickstrike, which resolves first?
A: Widow’s Bite resolves first. Widow’s Bite triggers after
the minion enters play, which is one step before the minion
engages a player.

THE NIGHT NURSE (#19)

Q: If the only status card on a hero is a tough status
card, is it discarded if I use The Night Nurse to heal that
hero?
A: Yes. The Night Nurse’s ability discards 1 status card from
that hero, no matter the type.

UNFLAPPABLE (#20)

Q: If while defending against an enemy attack, my
identity takes damage from a “Boost” ability but takes
no damage from the attacking enemy otherwise, can I
still trigger Unflappable to draw a card?
A: Yes. The cost of the ability on Unflappable only requires
that the defending identity take no damage during step 4 of
the enemy attack.
Q: Counterspell says “Attach to your hero.” If I draw
Counterspell while in alter-ego form, what happens?
A: Counterspell attempts to attach to your hero but cannot.
Because it is unable to meet its condition, simply discard
it. (Do not reveal a new encounter card in its place.)

HULK HERO PACK
CRUSHING BLOW (#2)

Q: If Crushing Blow’s resource cost is reduced to 0, can
it be played without spend  resources?
A: Yes. The “You can only spend  resources to pay for this
card” ability on Crushing Blow only applies when actual
resources are being spent to pay for its resource cost. If its
resource cost is reduced to 0, no resources are required to
pay for Crushing Blow, so no  resources must be spent.

UNSTOPPABLE FORCE (#6)

Q: If Unstoppable Force’s resource cost is reduced to 0,
will I draw 1 card from its second ability?
A: No. Because no resources were spent to pay for
Unstoppable Force’s resource cost, its “If you paid for this
ability using only  resources...” condition was not fulfilled,
so that effect will not resolve.

CLASH OF TITANS (#28)

Q: If my highest-ATK character is an ally, and the attack
from Clash of Titans is undefended, which takes the
damage: my identity or the ally that was attacked?
A: The ally will take all damage from the undefended attack.

RISE OF RED SKULL E XPANSION
HAWKEYE’S QUIVER (#3)

DOCTOR STR ANGE HERO PACK

COUNTERSPELL (#30)

Q: Can I resolve Images of Ikonn if the villain is already
confused and there is no threat on a scheme?
A: Yes. As long as any part of the ability on Images of Ikonn
can change the game state, then it will do as many effects
as it is able. While its first effect may fail to change the
game state if the villain is already confused and there is no
threat on a scheme, its second effect can change the game
state by placing itself in the Invocation deck discard pile.

Q: After using Hawkeye’s Quiver to search the top
5 cards of my deck, what should I do with those cards?
A: Shuffle those cards back into Hawkeye’s deck. After
a search ability is completed—no matter if that ability
searches the whole deck or only a portion of the deck—the
entire deck is shuffled.

MARKED FOR DEATH (#28)

Q: When Marked for Death is revealed, if a copy of
Mockingbird is already under a player’s control who is
not Clint Barton, what happens?
A: The Clint Barton player must search for Mockingbird in
their hand, deck, discard pile, and play area, though cannot
place their Mockingbird under Marked for Death as there
is already a unique character in play with the same title/
subtitle (shuffle after searching a deck). However, when
Marked for Death is defeated, any copy of Mockingbird in
play (even one controlled by another player) is returned to
its owner’s hand.

Rules Reference

JESSICA DREW (#31B)

Q: Does Jessica Drew’s Double Agent ability require her
deck to be built with two aspects?
A: Yes. An equal number of cards from two different aspects
must be included in her deck.

FINESSE (#33)

Q: Can Finesse generate a resource to pay for an aspect
card’s ability (such as Jarnbjorn)?
A: Yes. As long as the resource generated by Finesse is
spent on an aspect card (its resource cost or a cost within
that aspect card’s ability), Finesse can be used.

QUICKSILVER HERO PACK
QUICKSILVER (#1A)

Q: If Quicksilver attempts to make a basic attack or basic
thwart while stunned or confused, can his Super Speed
ability trigger?
A: No. Stunned and confused status cards replace the usage
of the basic power with their removal. If Quicksilver makes a
basic attack while stunned or a basic thwart while confused,
he is not considered to have used a basic power and the
condition of his Super Speed ability is not met.

SC ARLET WITCH HERO PACK

THE ONCE AND FUTURE K ANG
SCENARIO PACK

HEX BOLT (#4)

DEPOWERED (#20)

Q: If Depowered is in Doctor Strange’s play area, can the
Doctor Strange player still use the Invocation deck?
A: Yes. The abilities on cards in the Invocation deck are merely
resolved, not played.

WA SP HERO PACK

Q: For the second sentence of Hex Bolt, do the bulleted
abilities resolve each time a card is discarded from the
encounter deck, or do the bulleted abilities resolve after
all 3 cards have been discarded?
A: As Hex Bolt does not contain an alteration effect, resolve
the first sentence of Hex Bolt entirely, without interruption.
Then, determine and resolve the appropriate bulleted
abilities based off of what was discarded.

SLIPPING SANITY (#23)

WASP (#1C)

Q: While Wasp is in Giant hero form, how does her first
ability interact the patrol keyword and the crisis icon?
A: Wasp’s first ability allows her basic thwart to
simultaneously remove threat from each scheme that Wasp
chooses. Although Wasp may choose the main scheme as
a target while a card with the patrol keyword or a crisis icon
is in play, no threat will be removed from the main scheme.
Due to the simultaneous nature of this ability, this applies
even if the card with the patrol keyword or crisis icon is
removed from play during her basic thwart’s resolution.
Q: While Wasp is in Giant hero form, how does her second
ability interact with the guard keyword?
A: Wasp’s second ability allows her basic attack to
simultaneously damage each enemy that Wasp chooses.
Although Wasp may choose the villain as a target while a
card with the guard keyword is in play, no damage will be
dealt to the villain. Due to the simultaneous nature of this
ability, this applies even if the card with the guard keyword
is removed from play during her basic attack’s resolution.
Q: While Wasp is in Giant hero form, how does her second
ability interact with multiple enemies who have the
retaliate keyword?
A: Wasp is considered to attack each target affected by her
divided basic attack. If Wasp’s basic attack is divided among
multiple enemies with the retaliate keyword, each instance
of retaliate will damage Wasp (in the order of her choice).

Q: Is it intentional that Scarlet Witch has two obligation
cards?
A: Yes. Scarlet Witch’s powers are chaotic, often working
in her favor, though also sometimes working against her.
While she has many cards within her personal set that
represent the positive facets of her powers, having multiple
obligations represents the negative facets.

GALA XY’S MOST WANTED EXPANSION
MODULAR ENCOUNTER SETS

Q: In the Galaxy’s Most Wanted Expansion, which sets
are considered modular encounter sets?
A: If an encounter set is not scenario-specific (containing
the name of that scenario in its encounter set name area)
or campaign-specific (containing the word “Campaign”
in its encounter set name area), then it is modular. The
eight modular encounter sets in the Galaxy’s Most Wanted
Expansion are: Badoon Headhunter, Band of Badoon,
Galactic Artifacts, Kree Militants, Menagerie Medley,
Power Stone, Space Pirates, and Ship Command.

CAMPAIGN MODE

Q: Do I have to play in expert mode for each scenario in
an expert campaign?
A: No. Increasing a campaign’s difficulty merely adds
additional cards or setup instructions to each scenario in
that campaign. It does not lock players into any other mode
of play. For each scenario within a campaign, players are
encouraged to choose the other modes of play that are
right for them.

Rules Reference

43

Q: If I play one scenario in expert mode, do I have to
play the next scenario using the same mode?
A: No. The players may, for instance, play one scenario of
the campaign using a combination of standard, heroic,
and skirmish modes, then play the next scenario of the
campaign using simply expert mode. Players can mix and
match modes as they see fit between each scenario in
a campaign.

ROCKET RACCOON (#29A)

Q: If Rocket Raccoon uses his “Tinkering” ability but the
Tech upgrade is not placed into a discard pile (such as due
to Collector’s ability), will Rocket Raccoon draw 2 cards?
A: Yes. Discarding is the act of attempting to place a
card into a discard pile. Even if the Tech upgrade ends up
in a different game area, the cost of Rocket Raccoon’s
“Tinkering” ability was still paid.

SALVAGE (#33)

Q: If the Hulk ally (Core Set #50) discards Salvage, what
happens?
A: Hulk’s ability checks all printed resources on Salvage
simultaneously, then resolves the appropriate effect
based on the result. Because this check and resolution is
simultaneous, the player who controls Hulk chooses the
order in which the effects resolve.
