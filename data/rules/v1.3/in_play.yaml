name: "In Play"
version: "1.3"
rule_text: |
  Non-event cards that have been played or put into play are
  “in play” until a card ability or other game effect removes
  them from play. The top card of the villain deck and the top
  card of the main scheme deck are also in play.
  Cards in a player’s hand, deck, and discard pile, as well as
  cards in the encounter deck, encounter discard pile, and
  unrevealed cards in the villain deck and the main scheme
  deck are out of play. Any cards that have been removed
  from the game or that have been set aside are also out of
  play.
  • A card enters play when it moves from an out-of-play
  area to a play area.
  • A card leaves play when it moves from a play area to
  an out-of-play area.
  • Card abilities only interact with, and can only
  target, cards that are in play, unless the ability text
  specifically refers to an out-of-play area.
  • Card abilities on all card types except event cards
  and treachery cards can only be initiated or affect the
  game while they are in play unless they specifically
  refer to being used from an out-of-play area.
  • Event cards and treachery cards implicitly resolve
  from an out-of-play area, by virtue of the rules
  pertaining to those card types.
