name: "Forced"
version: "1.3"
rule_text: |
  Forced is a bold trigger word. If the word “Forced”
  precedes a triggered ability, the ability’s initiation is
  mandatory.
  • For any given triggering condition, forced interrupts
  take priority and initiate before non-forced interrupts,
  and forced responses take priority and initiate before
  non-forced responses.
  • If two or more forced abilities would initiate at the
  same moment, the first player determines the order in
  which the abilities initiate, regardless of who controls
  the cards bearing those abilities.
  • Each forced ability must resolve as completely
  as possible before the next forced ability being
  triggered by the same triggering condition may
  initiate.
