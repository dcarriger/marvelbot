  A response ability is a type of triggered ability, indicated by
  the bold “Response” timing trigger. Response abilities may
  be executed after the specified triggering condition occurs,
  as described in the response’s ability text.
  • Multiple responses may be executed from the same
  triggering condition.
  • A response opportunity occurs immediately
  after its triggering condition has been resolved.
  Opportunities to respond occur in player order until
  all players have passed consecutively.
  • Once the opportunity to respond to a triggering
  condition has been passed consecutively by all
  players, further responses to that specific triggering
  condition cannot be used.
