rule_text: |
  An interrupt ability is a type of triggered ability, indicated
  by the bold “Interrupt” timing trigger. Interrupt abilities
  may be executed anytime the specified triggering condition
  occurs, as described in the interrupt’s ability text. The
  interrupt ability interrupts the resolution of the specified
  triggering condition, and resolves immediately before that
  triggering condition resolves.
  • Multiple interrupts may be triggered by the same
  triggering condition.
  • An interrupt ability is executed when its triggering
  condition becomes imminent, but before that
  triggering condition resolves. Opportunities to
  interrupt occur in player order until all players have
  passed consecutively.
  • Once all players have consecutively passed on the
  opportunity to interrupt an imminent triggering
  condition, further interrupts to that specific triggering
  condition cannot be used.
  • If an interrupt changes (via a replacement effect) or
  cancels an imminent triggering condition, further
  interrupts to the original triggering condition cannot
  be triggered.
