version: "1.3"
rule_text: |
  When a player wishes to play a card or initiate a triggered
  ability, that player first declares their intent. Then, the player
  checks the following conditions in order:
  1. Check play restrictions: can the card be played, or the
  ability initiated, at this time? (This includes verifying
  that the resolution of the effect could change the
  game.)
  2. Determine the cost (or costs) to play the card or initiate
  the ability, taking modifiers into account.
  If both conditions are met, follow these steps in order:
  3. Apply any modifiers to the cost(s).
  4. Pay the cost(s). If this step is reached and the cost(s)
  cannot be paid, abort this process without paying any
  costs.
  5. Make all “choose” decisions required to resolve the
  card.
  6. The card commences being played, or the effects of
  the ability attempt to initiate.
  7. The card is played or the ability (if not canceled in step
  six) resolves. The card enters play or, if it is an event
  card, its effects resolve and it is then placed in its
  owner’s discard pile.
  • If any of the above steps would make the triggering
  condition of an interrupt ability true, that ability may
  be initiated just before that triggering condition
  becomes true.
  • If any of the above steps would make the triggering
  condition of a response ability true, that ability
  may be initiated immediately after that triggering
  condition becomes true.
  • If the ability being initiated is on a card that is in play,
  the sequence does not stop from completing if that
  card leaves play during this sequence unless the card
  leaving play prevents a required cost from being
  paid.
