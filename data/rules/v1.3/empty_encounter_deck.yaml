name: "Empty Encounter Deck"
version: "1.3"
rule_text: |
  If the encounter deck runs out of cards, the encounter
  discard pile is immediately shuffled to create a new
  encounter deck. **An acceleration token is placed next to
  the scheme deck.** This token places an additional threat on
  the main scheme each round, during step one of the villain
  phase.
  â€¢ If all cards from the encounter deck are discarded
  while an ability is looking for a specified card, the
  ability fails to find the card, the deck reshuffles, an
  acceleration token is placed, and the game continues.
  No cards are discarded from the newly shuffled deck.
