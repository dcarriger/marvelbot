rule_text: |
  If players are instructed to perform a sequence “in player
  order”, the first player performs their part of the sequence
  first, followed by the other players in clockwise order.
  • If a sequence performed in player order does not
  conclude after each player has performed their part
  of the sequence once, the sequence of opportunities
  continues in a clockwise manner until it is complete.
  • The phrase “next player” always refers to the next
  (clockwise) player in player order.
