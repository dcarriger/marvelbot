name: "Constant Ability"
version: "1.3"
rule_text: |
  A constant ability is any non-keyword ability whose text
  contains no bold timing trigger defining its ability type. A
  constant ability becomes active as soon as its card enters
  play and remains active while the card is in play.
  • Some constant abilities continuously seek a specific
  condition (denoted by words such as “during”, “if”,
  or “while”). The effects of such abilities are active
  anytime the specific condition is met.
  • If multiple instances of the same constant ability
  are in play, each instance affects the game
  independently.
