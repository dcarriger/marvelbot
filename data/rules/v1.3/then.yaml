  If the effect text of an ability includes the word “then”,
  the text preceding the word “then” must be fully true or
  resolved before the remainder of the effect described after
  the word “then” can be resolved.
  • If the pre-”then” text of an effect fully resolves,
  the post-”then” text of the effect must also
  attempt to resolve.
  • If the pre-”then” text of an effect does not fully
  resolve, the post-”then” text does not attempt to
  resolve.
