rule_text: |
  “Limit X per [period]” is a limit that appears on some player
  cards. These limits are card-specific. Each copy of an ability
  with such a limit may be used X times per the specified
  period, per instance of that ability.
  • If an effect with a limit is canceled, the card is
  still considered to have been played or the ability
  initiated, and it counts toward the limit.
