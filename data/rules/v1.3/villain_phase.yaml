name: "Villain Phase"
version: "1.3"
rule_text: |
  The steps of the villain phase are:
  1. Place the amount of threat indicated in the main
  schemeâ€™s acceleration field onto that scheme. If any
  acceleration icons or tokens are active, additional threat
  equal to the number of such icons and tokens is also
  placed at this time.
  2. The villain activates once per player. For each
  activation, any minions engaged with that player also
  activate.
  3. Deal one encounter card to each player. Deal one
  additional card for each hazard symbol on a card in
  play. These additional cards are dealt in player order.
  4. Players reveal their dealt encounter cards. The first
  player reveals each of their encounter cards, one card
  at a time, resolving each card based on its card type.
  Each player repeats this process in player order, until
  no dealt encounter cards remain.
  5. Pass the first player token to the next clockwise player
  and end the round.
