name: "Attack"
version: "1.3"
rule_text: |
  Some game effects and card abilities reference an attack.
  There are a few different ways an attack can occur:
  • A hero can use their basic attack power to attack an
  enemy. A hero must exhaust to use this power. This
  deals damage equal to the hero’s ATK value to the
  enemy.
  • An ally can use its basic attack power to attack an
  enemy. This deals damage equal to the ally’s ATK
  value to the enemy.
  • If a triggered ability is labeled as an attack—such
  as “Hero Action (attack)”—resolving that ability is
  considered to attack the specified target. Unless
  specified by the ability’s text, a hero does not exhaust
  when using such an ability.
  • Hero and ally attacks can target any enemy, unless a
  card ability (such as guard) is preventing that enemy
  from being attacked.
  • Enemies can attack during step two of the villain
  phase.
  • Card abilities can cause the villain and/or minions to
  attack at other times if the ability explicitly instructs
  the villain or minion to “attack.”
