name: "Triggering Condition"
version: "1.3"
rule_text: |
  A triggering condition is a specific occurrence that takes
  place in the game. On card abilities, the triggering
  condition is the element of the ability that references
  such an occurrence, indicating the timing point at which
  the ability may be used. The description of an ability’s
  triggering condition usually follows the word “when” or
  “after.”
  • If a single game occurrence creates multiple
  triggering conditions (such as a single attack causing
  a character to both take damage and be defeated),
  those triggering conditions are handled with a single
  interrupt window and a single response window.
  During each of these windows, abilities that refer
  to any of the triggering conditions created by the
  occurrence may be used in any order.
