name: "Boost"
version: "1.3"
rule_text: |
  Each time the villain attacks or schemes,
  the villain is given one facedown card
  from the encounter deck, as a boost card.
  During the activation (and after any
  defenders are declared if the villain is
  attacking), all boost cards on the villain
  are turned face up one at a time. Add the number of boost
  icons on the card to the villain’s ATK value (if it is attacking)
  or SCH value (if it is scheming) for that activation. Boost
  icons are located at the bottom-right of the card.
  If the boost field has a star icon, it indicates that the card
  has a “Boost” ability. Refer to the card’s text box and
  resolve the “Boost” ability when the card is turned face up.
  The “Boost” ability is located beneath the divider line in the
  text box.
  • A star icon is not itself considered a boost icon, and
  does not contribute to the villain’s ATK or SCH value.
  • Only the ability text beneath the divider line is active
  on a card that is resolving as a boost card.
  • If additional boost cards are resolved for an
  activation, the boost icons are cumulative, and all
  “Boost” abilities on those cards resolve.
  • After applying a boost card to an activation, discard it.
