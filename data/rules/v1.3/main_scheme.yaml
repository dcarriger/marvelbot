name: "Main Scheme"
version: "1.3"
rule_text: |
  Main scheme is an encounter card type. The main scheme
  represents the villain’s primary objective.
  If the amount of threat on a main scheme is equal to or
  greater than its target threat value, the scheme deck
  advances. Remove the scheme from the game, and advance
  to the next stage of the main scheme deck.
  **If the villain completes the final stage of the main
  scheme deck, the villain wins the game.**
  • During step one of the villain phase, place the amount
  of threat indicated in the main scheme’s acceleration
  field (bottom-right corner) on that scheme. This value
  is modified by all active acceleration tokens and icons.
  • When the main scheme deck advances, excess threat
  from the previous stage does not carry over to the
  new stage.
  • When the main scheme deck advances, acceleration
  tokens on it carry over to the new stage.
