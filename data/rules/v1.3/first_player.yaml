name: "First Player"
version: "1.3"
rule_text: |
  A first player is determined by the players at the beginning
  of the game.
  The first player token is used to indicate which player is
  the first player. At the end of the round (during step five of
  the villain phase) the first player token passes to the next
  clockwise player, who becomes first player for the next
  round.
  If the first player is eliminated, the first player token
  immediately passes clockwise to the next player.
  The players as a group are encouraged to work together,
  but the first player decides the following:
  • If an encounter card targets a specific player or card,
  and there are multiple eligible targets, the first player
  selects among the eligible options.
  • If two or more effects would resolve simultaneously,
  the first player decides the order in which to resolve
  them.
  The first player has timing priority in the following situations:
  • The first player has the first opportunity to use
  an interrupt at each appropriate game moment.
  Interrupt opportunities then proceed among the
  remaining players in player order.
  • The first player has the first opportunity to use
  a response at each appropriate game moment.
  Response opportunities then proceed among the
  remaining players in player order
