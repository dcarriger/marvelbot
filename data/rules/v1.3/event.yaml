rule_text: |
  Event is a player card type that is generally played for an
  instantaneous effect.
  Each time a player plays an event card, its costs are paid,
  its effects resolve (or are canceled), and the card is placed
  in its owner’s discard pile after those effects resolve (or are
  canceled).
  • If the effects of an event are canceled, the card is still
  considered to have been played, and its costs remain
  paid. Only the effects are canceled.
  • Playing an event card from hand is always optional for
  a player, unless the event uses the word “must” in its
  play instructions.
  • An event card cannot be played unless the resolution
  of its effect (ignoring costs) could change the game.
