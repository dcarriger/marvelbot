name: "Player Elimination"
version: "1.3"
rule_text: |
  A player is eliminated from the game if their identity
  is defeated. This usually occurs when the character’s
  remaining hit points are reduced to zero.
  • When a player is eliminated, that player’s hand, all of
  the cards they control, and their deck are placed in
  their owners’ discard piles. Encounter cards dealt to the
  player are discarded. Any enemies engaged with that
  player engage the next clockwise player, retaining any
  damage, counters, and status cards on them.
  • When a player is eliminated, the remaining players
  continue to play the game. Eliminated players are
  considered to win or lose along with the rest of the
  group, depending on how they finish.
  • If a player is eliminated partway through the
  resolution of an ability, resolve the entire ability.
  • If all players are eliminated, the game ends and the
  players lose.
