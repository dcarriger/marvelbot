rule_text: |
  Sustained damage refers to the difference between a
  character’s maximum hit points and remaining hit points.
  • To calculate sustained damage for an identity or
  villain (using a hit point dial), start with the character’s
  maximum hit points (as indicated by its printed value
  modified by any card abilities or game effects), and
  subtract their remaining hit points (as indicated by
  the dial).
  • Sustained damage on an ally or minion is equal to the
  total value of all damage tokens on the card.
