  from the encounter deck. (If a minion is scheming, skip
  this step.)

  cards faceup one at a time. (If a minion is scheming,
  skip this step.) Then, in order:
  • Resolve any “Boost” abilities, indicated by the star
  icon in the boost field.
  • Increase the villain’s SCH value by one for each boost
  icon on the card.
