rule_text: |
  If the villain attacks or schemes, it is considered an
  activation.
  • During step two of the villain phase, the villain
  activates once per player. If the player resolving the
  activation is in hero form, the villain attacks. If the
  player resolving the activation is in alter-ego form,
  the villain schemes.
  • Some card abilities can also cause the villain to attack
  or scheme. These are also considered activations.
  • Each time the villain activates, give the villain
  one boost card from the encounter deck for that
  activation.
