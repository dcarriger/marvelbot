name: "Lasting Effects"
version: "1.3"
rule_text: |
  Some card abilities create effects or conditions that affect
  the game for a specified duration (such as “until the end of
  the phase” or “until the end of this attack”). Such effects are
  known as lasting effects.
  For the specified duration of a lasting effect, treat the effect
  as if it was a constant ability.
  • A lasting effect persists beyond the resolution of the
  ability that created it, for the duration specified by
  the effect. The effect continues to affect the game for
  the specified duration whether or not the card that
  created the lasting effect is in play.
  • If a card enters play (or changes status to meet the
  criteria of a specified set of affected cards) after the
  creation of a lasting effect, it is still affected by that
  lasting effect.
  • A lasting effect expires as soon as the timing point
  specified by its duration is reached. This means that
  an “until the end of the round” lasting effect expires
  just before an “at the end of the round” ability or
  delayed effect may initiate.
  • A lasting effect that expires at the end of a specified
  time period can only be initiated during that time
  period.
