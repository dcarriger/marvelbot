  Playing a card involves paying the card’s cost and placing
  the card in the play area. This causes the card to enter play
  (or, in the case of an event card, to resolve its ability and be
  placed in the discard pile). Cards are played from a player’s
  hand.
  Some abilities cause cards to be put into play. This bypasses
  the need to pay the card’s cost as well as any restrictions or
  prohibitions regarding playing that card. A card that is put
  into play enters play in its controller’s play area.
  • When an event card is played, place it on the table,
  resolve its ability, and place the card in its owner’s
  discard pile.
  • A card that is put into play is not considered to have
  been played.
  • When a card is put into play, its resource cost is
  ignored.
  • Unless otherwise stated by the “put into play” effect,
  cards that are put into play must do so in a play area
  or state that matches the rules of playing the card.
