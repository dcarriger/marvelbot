rule_text: |
  Ally is a player card type that represents a player’s friends,
  supporters, or companions.
  • If an ally enters play, it remains in play until a card
  ability or game effect causes it to leave play. If an
  ally’s remaining hit points are reduced to zero, it is
  defeated and discarded from play.
  • During a player’s turn, they may use any number of
  allies they control to attack or thwart. An ally must
  exhaust to pay the cost of being used in this way.
  • After an attack or thwart attempt using an ally
  resolves, there is often consequential damage that
  must be dealt to the ally, as indicated beneath the
  ally’s ATK or THW field. This damage must be dealt
  directly to the ally.
  • If a player is attacked, any player may exhaust an ally
  they control to defend against the attack. If an ally
  defends against an attack, all damage from the attack
  is dealt to the ally.
