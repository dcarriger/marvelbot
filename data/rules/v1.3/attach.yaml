rule_text: |
  If a card uses the phrase “attach to”, it must be attached to
  (placed beneath and slightly overlapped by) the specified
  game element as it enters play.
  • Once a card is attached, it remains in play until either
  the element it is attached to leaves play (in which
  case the attached card is discarded) or an ability or
  game effect causes the attached card to leave play.
  • An attached card exhausts and readies independently
  of the game element it is attached to.
  • The “attach to” phrase is checked for legality when
  the card would be attached to a game element, but it
  is not checked again after it is attached. If the initial
  “attach to” check does not pass, the card is not able
  to be attached, so it remains in its prior state or game
  area. If such a card cannot remain in its prior state or
  game area, discard it.
