rule_text: |
  The game constantly checks and (if necessary) updates the
  count of any variable quantity that is being modified.
  Anytime a new modifier is applied or removed, the entire
  quantity is recalculated from the start, considering the
  unmodified base value and all active modifiers.
  • The calculation of a value treats all modifiers as being
  applied simultaneously. However, while performing
  the calculation, all additive and subtractive modifiers
  are calculated before doubling and/or halving
  modifiers are calculated.
  • If a value is “set” to a specific number, the set
  modifier overrides all non-set modifiers. If multiple
  set modifiers are in conflict, the most recently
  resolved set modifier takes precedence.
  • After all active modifiers have been taken into
  account, if a value is below zero, it is treated as zero:
  a card cannot have “negative” icons, attributes, traits,
  cost, or keywords.
  • Fractional values are rounded up after all modifiers
  have been applied.
