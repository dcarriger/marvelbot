rule_text: |
  Upgrade is a player card type that represents powers,
  attacks, equipment, and other assets that are (in most cases)
  at an identity’s immediate disposal.
  • An upgrade is active so long as it is in play, and it
  remains in play until a card ability causes it to leave
  play.
  • Most upgrade cards enter play near a player’s identity
  card, and modify the player’s hero or alter-ego (or
  both).
  • Some upgrades enter play and “attach to” another
  card. These upgrades modify the card they are
  attached to, not the hero or alter-ego of the player
  who played the upgrade.
