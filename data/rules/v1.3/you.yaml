  In **_Marvel Champions_**, each player takes on the role of a
  Marvel Hero, represented by the identity card. Essentially,
  the player is their identity card while playing the game.
  • While interpreting card text, if the word “you” can
  be interpreted as referring to the player, it should be
  interpreted as such. For example, Interrogation Room
  reads, “After you defeat a minion, exhaust Interrogation
  Room…” Any time the player controlling this card
  defeats a minion, the ability may be used.
  • If a specific character is required to interpret an ability
  using the word “you”, the identity card is the character
  that must be used. For example, Toe to Toe reads,
  “Hero Action (attack): Choose an enemy. That enemy
  attacks you.” As attacks are directed against individual
  characters, “you” refers to the identity card of the of
  the player who played this event.
