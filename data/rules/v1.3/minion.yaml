name: "Minion"
version: "1.3"
rule_text: |
  Minion is an encounter card type. Minions represent
  supporters of the villain and/or enemies of the heroes.
  If a minion enters play, it engages the player who is
  revealing the card from the encounter deck or resolving
  the ability that put the minion into play, unless an ability
  specifies otherwise.
  • If a minion enters play, it remains in play until a card
  ability or game effect causes it to leave play.
  • If a minion has zero or fewer remaining hit points, it is
  defeated and discarded.
  • Minions engaged with a player activate (one minion
  at a time) during step two of the villain phase, after
  the villain activates. If the engaged player is in hero
  form, these minions attack. If the engaged player is in
  alter-ego form, these minions scheme.
