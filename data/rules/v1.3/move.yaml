rule_text: |
  Some abilities allow players to move game elements, such
  as cards, damage, or threat.
  • When an element moves, it cannot move to its same
  (current) placement.
  • If there is no valid source or destination for a move,
  the move cannot be made.
  • It is possible for damage to move between dials and
  cards (and vice versa).
  • If damage is moved from a dial to a card, increase the
  hit points tracked by the dial by the specified amount
  (no higher than the card’s maximum hit points), and
  place the same amount of damage on the card.
  • If damage is moved from a card to a dial, remove
  damage from the card and reduce the dial by the
  same amount.
  • If damage is moved to a character, the moved
  damage is considered to be dealt to that character.
  • If threat is moved to a scheme, the moved threat is
  considered to be placed to that scheme.
