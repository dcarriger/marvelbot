rule_text: |
  Identity is a player card type that represents which character
  a player is playing in the game.
  A player’s identity card is a double-sided card that
  represents their hero on one side and their alter-ego on the
  other. The side that is face up indicates the form (hero or
  alter-ego) that player is currently in.
  • Each player begins the game in alter-ego form.
  • If a card refers to a hero or alter-ego by title, it refers
  only to the identity with that title, and not to the
  other side of the card.
