name: "Drawing Cards"
version: "1.3"
rule_text: |
  If a player is instructed to draw one or more cards, those
  cards are drawn from the top of their deck.
  If a player draws two or more cards as the result of a
  single game step or card ability, those cards are drawn
  simultaneously.
  Drawn cards are added to a player’s hand.
  Each player’s hand size is checked at the end of the player
  phase. If a player has more cards in their hand than their
  hand size value at this time, they must choose and discard
  cards from hand until they are at their hand size.
