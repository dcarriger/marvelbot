name: "Star Icon"
version: "1.3"
rule_text: |
  A star icon is used in conjunction with a
  card’s stat or boost field to indicate that
  there is a mandatory ability in the text
  box that corresponds to that field. In and
  of itself, the star icon has no effect; it is merely a reminder
  to check the card’s text box whenever that field is used.
  • If a star icon is located next to an enemy’s ATK or
  SCH value, the icon serves as a reminder to check
  that enemy’s text box whenever that enemy uses that
  value to attack or scheme.
  • If a star icon is located in the ATK or SCH field of an
  attachment, the icon serves as a reminder to check
  that attachment’s text box whenever the attached
  enemy uses the value that field is modifying to attack
  or scheme.
  • If a star icon is located next to an ally’s ATK or THW
  value, the icon serves as a reminder to check that
  ally’s text box whenever that ally uses that value to
  attack or thwart.
  • If a star icon is located next to a hero’s ATK, THW,
  or DEF, or next to an alter-ego’s REC value, the icon
  serves as a reminder to check that character’s text
  box whenever they use that value to attack, thwart,
  defend, or recover.
  • If a game step or ability references a power with the
  value of star <:star:667077039236579340>, that value is treated as 0.
  • If a star icon is located in an encounter card’s boost
  field, the icon serves as a reminder to check that
  card’s text box whenever that card is turned face up
  as a boost card during the villain’s activation.

  _For example, Tiger Shark has an ATK value of 3, with
  a star icon in the field. Whenever Tiger Shark attacks, 
  this icon reminds the players to check his text box.
  In the text box, they find the mandatory “Forced Response”, 
  which reads, “After Tiger Shark attacks, give him a tough
  status card.” Because this star is associated with
  Tiger Shark’s attack power, only the ability that 
  references his attack power is used. The “Boost” ability,
  which does not reference this power, is ignored._
