version: "1.3"
rule_text: |
  Many cards and abilities contain specific instructions
  pertaining to when or how they may or may not be used,
  or to specific conditions that must be true in order to use
  them.
  • In order to use an ability or play a card, all of its play
  restrictions must be observed.
  • A permission is an optional play restriction, which
  allows a player to play a card or use an ability outside
  the timing or specifications provided by the game
  rules. For example, a permission might allow an ally
  card to be played from a player’s discard pile.
