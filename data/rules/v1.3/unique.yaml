name: "Unique"
version: "1.3"
rule_text: |
  A card with a <:unique:667076268981878794> icon before its title is unique.
  • The players as a group are permitted to have only
  one copy of each unique card (by title) in play.
  • A player cannot include more than one copy of each
  unique card (by title) in their deck. The identity card is
  included in this evaluation.
  In the Marvel setting, it is possible for multiple people to
  bear the same title. _(For example, more than one person can
  bear the title of “Captain America”, but there is only one
  Steve Rogers.)_ Because of this, a comparison of alter-egos
  and/or subtitles between two cards may create the following
  exceptions to the unique rules stated above:
  • If two identities share the same title, but each has a
  different alter-ego, they may coexist in play.
  • If two unique allies share the same title, but each
  has a different subtitle, they may coexist in a player’s
  deck and in play.
  • If a hero and a unique ally share the same title, but
  the alter-ego and the subtitle are different, they may
  coexist in deckbuilding and in play.
