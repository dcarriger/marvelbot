name: Acceleration Token
version: "1.4"
rule_text: |
  Acceleration tokens are functionally equivalent to acceleration icons. They are placed next to the main scheme as a reminder to add X additional threat to the main scheme during step one of the villain phase, where X is the number of acceleration tokens in play.
  Acceleration tokens enter play through one of two effects:
  • If the encounter deck is empty, place one acceleration token next to the main scheme.
  • Card effects may instruct the players to add an acceleration token to play.
  Acceleration tokens cannot be removed from play. Unlike other tokens, when a main scheme card leaves play, the acceleration token does not get discarded.
