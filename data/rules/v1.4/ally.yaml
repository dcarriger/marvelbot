name: Ally
version: "1.4"
rule_text: |
  Ally is a player card type that represents an identity's friends, supporters, or companions.
  • If an ally enters play, it remains in play until a card ability or game effect causes it to leave play. If an ally’s remaining hit points are reduced to zero, it is defeated and discarded from play.
  • During a player’s turn, they may use any number of allies they control to attack or thwart. An ally must exhaust to attack or thwart.
  • After an ally is used to attack or thwart, deal consequential damage to that ally equal to the number of consequential damage icons (2) beneath the ally's ATK or THW field. _(If an ally attempts to attack or thwart while stunned or confused, respectively, that ally will not take consequential damage.)_
  • If a player is attacked, any player may exhaust an ally they control to defend against the attack. If an ally defends against an attack, all damage from the attack is dealt to the ally.
  • Attacks, thwarts, defenses, action abilities, and triggered abilities that resolve from allies in play under a player's control are not considered to be
  performed by that player's identity.
