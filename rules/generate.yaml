  Resources are used to pay the cost to play cards and to pay
  certain ability costs.
  • A player can generate resources to pay a cost by
  discarding cards from their hand to generate the
  resource or resources indicated at the bottom-left
  corner of the card, or by using card abilities that
  generate resources.
  • There are three types of resources in the game:
  energy, mental, and physical. Wild resources can be
  used as any of these types.
  • To pay the cost of playing a card, a number of
  resources equal to (or greater than) the card’s cost
  must be generated. For most cards, any type (or mix
  of types) of resources can be used to pay this cost.
  • If an ability has a resource cost, a number of
  resources equal to or greater than this cost must be
  generated. Many abilities require specific resource
  types, and the specified types in the specified
  quantities must be generated in order to pay the cost
  of the ability.
  • Excess resources generated toward any cost are lost,
  and do not carry over to future costs.
