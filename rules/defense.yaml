name: "Defense"
rule_text: |
  When an enemy makes an attack, the players have the
  option to defend against the attack. There are a few
  different ways this can occur:
  • A hero can use their basic defense power to defend
  against an attack. A hero must exhaust to use this
  power. The amount of damage dealt by the attack is
  reduced by the hero’s DEF value, and any remaining
  damage is dealt to the defending hero.
  • An ally can exhaust to defend against an attack.
  Damage from the attack is dealt to the ally.
  • If a player defends an attack (against another player)
  with a hero or ally they control, that player becomes
  the new target of the attack.
  
  _For example, Shield Block reads: “Interrupt (defense): When
  you would take any amount of damage, exhaust Captain
  America’s Shield to prevent all of that damage.” Because
  Shield Block is a defense card, it can only be played while
  the Captain America player is the target of an attack._
