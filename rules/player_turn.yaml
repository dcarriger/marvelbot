name: "Player Turn"
rule_text: |
  During their turn, a player may perform the following
  options, in any order. Each option (except “change form”)
  may be performed as many times as the player is able, so
  long as they are able to pay the required costs.
  • Change form from hero to alter-ego, or from alterego to hero. 
  **This option may only be performed once each turn.**
  • Play an ally, upgrade, or support card from hand.
  • Use their alter-ego’s basic recovery (if in alter-ego
  form) or their hero’s basic attack or thwart power (if in
  hero form).
  • Use an ally card they control in play to attack an
  enemy or thwart a scheme.
  • Trigger an “Action” card ability on a card in play they
  control, on an encounter card in play, or by playing
  an event card with such a timing trigger from their
  hand. If the action ability is preceded by “Hero” or
  “Alter-Ego”, the player must be in the specified form
  in order to trigger the ability.
  • Ask another player to trigger an “Action” ability on
  a card in play they control or on an event card they
  might have in hand. The other player then decides
  whether or not to trigger the ability. (Another player
  may offer to use an action during the active player’s
  turn, as well.)
