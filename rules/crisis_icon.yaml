name: "Crisis Icon"
rule_text: |
  Side scheme is an encounter card type that represents
  additional obstacles and distractions the heroes are
  confronted with.
  If a side scheme is revealed, it enters play and is placed next
  to the main scheme deck.
  • Each side scheme enters play with an amount of
  threat on it equal to the card’s starting threat value
  (indicated at the bottom of the card).
  • A side scheme remains in play until there is no threat
  on it (which causes it to be defeated and discarded),
  or until a card ability removes it from play. (Threat can
  be removed from side schemes by using the thwart
  power of heroes and allies, or by using card abilities.)
  The following icons indicate different effects that a side
  scheme might have on the game:
  If a side scheme has the crisis icon <:crisis:667076210357960714>, that side
  scheme must be discarded before threat can be
  removed from the main scheme.
  For each acceleration icon <:acceleration:667076458522607622> in play, one additional
  threat is placed on the main scheme during step
  one of the villain phase.
  For each side scheme with the hazard icon <:hazard:667076504139595776>, an
  additional encounter card is dealt during step
  three of the villain phase. Additional cards are
  dealt in player order (first additional card to the
  first player, the second to the second player, etc.).
