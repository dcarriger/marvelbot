name: "Engaged"
rule_text: |
  If a minion enters play, it engages a player, and is placed in
  front of that player’s play area.
  Unless otherwise specified by the minion or by the effect
  that put the minion into play, the minion engages the player
  who is resolving the current encounter card.
  • An engaged minion remains engaged with the same
  player until it is defeated, removed from play, or a
  card ability causes it to engage another player.
