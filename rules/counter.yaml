rule_text: |
  All-purpose counters can be used to track
  a variety of different game states and
  statuses. They have no inherent rules.
  Card abilities can create and define a number of different
  counter types, such as “arrow counters” or “web counters.”
  If a counter is called for, an all-purpose counter is used to
  track its presence in the game.
