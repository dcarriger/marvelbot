rule_text: |
  If an enemy is instructed to scheme, follow these steps:
  1. If a villain is scheming, give it one facedown boost card
  from the encounter deck. (If a minion is scheming, skip
  this step.)
  2. If a villain is scheming, flip each of the villain’s boost
  cards faceup one at a time. (If a minion is scheming,
  skip this step.) Then, in order:
  • Resolve any “Boost” abilities, indicated by the star
  icon in the boost field.
  • Increase the villain’s SCH value by one for each boost
  icon on the card.
  • Discard each boost card after it is resolved.
  3. Place threat on the main scheme equal to the scheming
  villain or minion’s modified SCH value.
