name: "Replacement Effects"
rule_text: |
  A replacement effect is an effect that replaces the handling
  of one resolution with a different means of handling that
  resolution. Most replacement effects are interrupt abilities
  in the format of “when [triggering condition] would happen,
  do [replacement effect] instead.” After all responses to the
  original triggering condition have resolved and it is time
  to resolve the triggering condition itself, the replacement
  effect resolves instead.
  • If multiple replacement effects are initiated against
  the same triggering condition, the most recent
  replacement effect is the one that is used for the
  resolution of the triggering condition.
