name: "Modes of Play"
rule_text: |
  Before starting a game of **_Marvel Champions_**, players can
  customize their experience by choosing from different
  modes of play. The modes of play are:
  Standard Mode — Standard Mode is the basic mode of
  play for all scenarios. To play in Standard Mode, follow
  the normal content and setup instructions for the chosen
  scenario.
  Expert Mode — Expert Mode is for advanced players who
  seek a greater challenge. To play in Expert Mode, follow
  the content and setup instructions for the chosen scenario,
  using the listed expert mode villain stages, and add the
  Expert encounter set to encounter deck.
  Rookie Mode — Rookie Mode allows players to enjoy
  a more forgiving experience. Rookie Mode follows the
  Standard Mode rules with one exception: when the first
  stage of the villain is defeated, the players win the game.
  Hazard Mode — Hazard Mode is for players who prefer a greater
  challenge than Expert Mode, but a lesser difficulty than Heroic
  Mode. Heroic Mode follows Expert Mode rules with one exception:
  during step three of each villain phase, the first player
  receives an additional encounter card.
  Heroic Mode — Heroic Mode allows players to customize
  their challenge through scaling difficulty. Heroic Mode
  follows the Expert Mode rules with one exception: before
  starting a game in Heroic Mode, the player group chooses
  a heroic level number, such as heroic level 1 or 4. Then, for
  the remainder of that game, during step three of each villain
  phase, deal X additional encounter cards to each player,
  where X is equal to the chosen heroic level number.
  For instance, if players choose heroic level 1, each player will
  be dealt a minimum of 2 encounter cards during each villain
  phase (1 from the normal villain phase step and 1 from the
  heroic level); if players choose heroic level 4, each player will
  be dealt a minimum of 5 encounter cards during each villain
  phase.
