name: "Uses"
rule_text: |
  When a card with this keyword enters
  play, place X all-purpose counters from the token pool on
  the card. The word following the value establishes and
  identifies the type of uses the card holds.
  Each card with this keyword also has an ability that
  references the type of use established by the keyword
  as part of the cost. When such an ability spends a use, a
  counter of that type must be removed from the card.
  After a card with uses spends its final use (and the effect
  resolves), discard the card.
