name: "Wild Resource"
rule_text: |
  When a player generates a wild resource, they must specify
  which resource type (energy, mental, or physical) it is being
  used as.
  • When resources are not being generated for a cost, a
  wild resource does not have any characteristic other
  than “wild resource.” In such contexts, wild resources
  cannot be interpreted as any of the other resource
  types.
