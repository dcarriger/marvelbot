rules_text: |
  When a minion with the villainous keyword activates, give it a
  facedown boost card from the top of the encounter deck. When you
  resolve that minion’s activation, turn the boost card faceup and
  apply its boost icons to the minion’s stats for this activation. If
  the boost card has a boost ability, resolve its effects. Discard
  the boost card after the activation.
