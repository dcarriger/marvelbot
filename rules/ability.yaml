name: "Ability"
rule_text: |
  An ability is game text that a card contributes to the game.
  • Card abilities only interact with cards that are in play,
  unless the ability specifically refers to an out-of-play
  area or element.
  • Card abilities on hero, alter-ego, ally, upgrade, and
  support cards may only be used if the card is in play,
  unless the ability specifically refers to being used
  from an out-of-play state. Event cards implicitly
  interact with the game from an out-of-play area, as
  per the rules of the event card type.
  • An ability can only be initiated if its effect could
  change the game. Assess this without accounting for
  the consequences of the cost payment or interaction
  with other abilities.
  • When an ability has more than one sentence of text,
  the ability is resolved one sentence at a time.
  • An ability prefaced by a bold timing trigger followed
  by a colon is referred to as a triggered ability. An
  ability without a bold timing trigger is referred to as a
  constant ability.
  • Player card abilities cannot resolve during game
  setup, unless prefaced by a “Setup” timing trigger.
  • The resolution of the following ability types is
  mandatory: constant abilities, “Setup” abilities,
  “When Revealed” abilities, “When Defeated”
  abilities, “Forced Interrupt” abilities, “Forced
  Response” abilities, “Boost” abilities, and keywords.
  If one of these ability types uses the word “may”, the
  part of the ability following “may” is optional.
  • The resolution of the following ability types is
  optional: “Action”, “Interrupt”, “Response”,
  “Resource”. The player who controls the card that has
  an optional ability determines whether or not to use
  that ability at the appropriate time
