name: "Obligation"
rule_text: |
  Obligation is an encounter card type that represents a
  commitment or obstacle that an identities alter-ego might
  have to face or overcome.
  Each identity is associated with one (or more) obligation
  cards. If an identity is being played, all of that identity’s
  associated obligation cards are shuffled into the encounter
  deck during setup.
  If an obligation card is revealed from the encounter deck,
  it is given to the player who controls its associated identity.
  That player must decide how to resolve the obligation.
  • If the identity associated with a revealed obligation
  card has been eliminated, ignore the card’s ability,
  remove it from the game, and reveal an additional
  encounter card.
  • If a revealed obligation card does not have an
  associated identity, the player who revealed the card
  chooses how to resolve the obligation.
