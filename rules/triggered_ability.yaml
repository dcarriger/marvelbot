name: "Triggered Ability"
rule_text: |
  A triggered ability is indicated by a bold timing trigger
  followed by a colon and the rest of the ability text.
  • A triggered ability on a player card can only be
  initiated if its effect could change the game on its
  own. This potential is assessed without taking into
  account the consequences of the cost payment or
  future responses to the effect.
  • Unless prefaced by the word “Forced”, all action and
  response abilities are optional.
  • “Forced” abilities, “When Revealed” abilities, and
  “When Defeated” abilities are triggered by the game
  at the ability’s appropriate timing point.
  • If the bold timing trigger of an ability contains the
  word “Hero” or “Alter-Ego”, the ability can only
  be used if the player triggering the ability is in the
  specified form.
  • If quotation marks are used around a timing trigger
  and colon, the quoted text is not itself a timing
  trigger, but is instead referring to other abilities with
  that trigger.
