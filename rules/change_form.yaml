name: "Form"
rule_text: |
  A player can be in either hero or alter-ego form at a given
  time. This is indicated by the player’s identity card.
  • Once each round, during their turn, each player is
  permitted to change form by flipping their identity
  card.
  • When a player changes form, only the form changes.
  The character retains their sustained damage, status
  cards, lasting effects, attachments, tokens, and
  current state (ready or exhausted).
  • If a card ability causes a player to change forms,
  it does not count against the one voluntary form
  change the player is permitted during their turn that
  round.
  • While a player is in hero form, card abilities that
  interact with their alter-ego do not interact with
  their identity.
  • While a player is in alter-ego form, card abilities
  that interact with their hero do not interact with
  their identity.
