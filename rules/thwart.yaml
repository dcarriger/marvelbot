name: "Thwart"
rule_text: |
  Some game effects and card abilities reference a thwart
  attempt. There are a few different ways this can occur:
  • A hero can use their basic thwart power to thwart a
  scheme. A hero must exhaust to use this power. This
  removes threat equal to the hero’s THW value from
  the scheme.
  • An ally can use its basic thwart power to thwart a
  scheme. This removes threat equal to the ally’s THW
  value from the scheme.
  • If a triggered ability is labeled as a thwart—such
  as “Hero Action (thwart)”—resolving that ability is
  considered to thwart the specified scheme. Unless
  specified by the ability’s text, a hero does not exhaust
  when using such an ability.
