name: "Card Types"
rule_text: |
  The game’s card types are: ally, attachment, environment,
  event, identity (hero and alter-ego), main scheme, minion,
  obligation, resource, side scheme, support, treachery,
  upgrade, and villain.
  • If an ability causes a card to change its card type,
  it loses all other card types it might possess and
  functions as would any card of the new card type.
