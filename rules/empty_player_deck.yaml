name: "Empty Player Deck"
rule_text: |
  If a player deck runs out of cards, the player shuffles their
  discard pile to make a new deck. That player immediately
  deals themself one card from the encounter deck.
  If the playerâ€™s draw deck empties and reshuffles while the
  player was drawing cards, the player continues to draw
  cards up to the specified number. If this happened while the
  player was discarding cards from their deck, no cards are
  discarded from the newly shuffled deck.
