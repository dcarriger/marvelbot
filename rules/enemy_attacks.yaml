name: "Enemy Attacks"
rule_text: |
  To resolve an enemy attack, follow these steps:
  1. If a villain is attacking, give it one facedown boost card
  from the encounter deck. (If a minion is attacking, skip
  this step.)
  2. If a player wishes to defend, that player exhausts a hero
  or ally as the defender. If a player other than the target
  player defends, the defending player becomes the
  target player for this attack.
  3. If a villain is attacking, flip each of the villain’s boost
  cards faceup one at a time. (If a minion is attacking,
  skip this step.) Then, in order:
  • Resolve any “Boost” abilities, indicated by the star
  icon in the boost field.
  • Increase the villain’s ATK value by one for each boost
  icon on the card.
  • Discard each boost card after it is resolved.
  4. Deal damage from the attack equal to the attacking
  villain or minion’s modified ATK value, based on the
  following:
  • If a hero defends the attack, the amount of damage
  dealt is reduced by that hero’s DEF value, and the
  remaining damage from the attack is dealt to that
  hero.
  • If an ally defends the attack, all damage from the
  attack is dealt to the ally. (If the ally is defeated by the
  attack, additional damage does not carry over to the
  hero.)
  • If no character defends the attack, the attack is
  considered undefended. All damage from the attack
  is dealt to the identity that is resolving this activation.
