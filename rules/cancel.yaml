name: "Cancel"
rule_text: |
  Some card abilities can cancel card or game effects.
  • Cancel abilities interrupt the initiation of effects and
  prevent them from initiating.
  • Anytime the effects of an ability are canceled, the
  ability (apart from its effects) is still regarded as
  initiated, and any costs are still paid. Only the effects
  are prevented from initiating, and do not resolve.
  • If the effects of an event card are canceled, the card
  is still considered played, and it is discarded.
  • If the effects of a treachery card are canceled, the
  card is still regarded as revealed, and it is still placed
  in the encounter discard pile.
