name: "Control"
rule_text: |
  A card’s owner is the player whose deck contained the card
  at the start of the game. The scenario is considered to be
  the owner of the encounter deck and each encounter card.
  • Cards enter play under their owner’s control.
  Encounter cards are considered to be under the
  control of the scenario.
  • Control of a card remains constant unless an ability
  explicitly causes the card to change control.
  • A player controls the cards in their own out-of-play
  areas (such as the hand, the deck, and the discard
  pile).
  • If a card that has changed control leaves play, after
  the resolution of the game occurrence that makes it
  leave play, the card is physically placed in its owner’s
  equivalent out-of-play area (hand, deck, or discard
  pile). Other card abilities cannot interact with this
  secondary physical placement.
  • If a character changes control while it is in play, it
  remains in the same state (i.e., readied or exhausted,
  damaged or not, etc.) and is moved to its new
  controller’s play area.
  • Upgrades or attachments on a card that changes
  control also change control to the same new
  controller.
  • Unless a duration is specified, a control change
  persists as long as the card remains in play.
