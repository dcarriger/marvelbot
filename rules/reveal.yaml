name: "Reveal"
rule_text: |
  During step four of the villain phase, each player (in player
  order) reveals and resolves all facedown encounter cards
  that have been dealt to them, one card at a time.
  To reveal an encounter card, a player flips the card faceup
  and resolves the card, including any keywords and “When
  Revealed” effects. Resolve revealed encounter cards based
  on their card type, as follows. If the revealed card is:
  • an attachment, it enters play attached to the element
  specified by its text.
  • a minion, it enters play engaged with the player
  revealing the card.
  • a treachery, its effects resolve and it is discarded.
  • an environment, it enters play next to the villain.
  • a side scheme, it enters play next to the main scheme.
  • an obligation, it is given to the player specified by
  the card, and that player resolves its text.
  If a player is instructed by card text to reveal an encounter
  card from the encounter deck or any other game area, this
  same resolution procedure applies.
