name: "Exhausted"
rule_text: |
  If a card is exhausted, it is rotated 90 degrees.
  • An exhausted card cannot be exhausted again until it
  is ready. Cards are typically readied by a game step
  or card ability.
  • A card ability on an exhausted card is active and
  can still interact with the game state. However, if an
  exhausted card must exhaust to pay the cost of using
  its ability, that ability cannot be used until the card
  is ready.
