name: "Max"
rule_text: |
  “Max X per [period]” imposes a maximum across all copies
  of a card (by title) for all players. Generally, this phrase
  imposes a maximum number of times that copies of that
  card can be played during the designated time period.
  If a maximum appears as part of an ability, it imposes a
  maximum number of times that the ability can be initiated
  from all copies (by title) of cards bearing that ability
  (including itself) during the designated period.
  • If an effect with a maximum is canceled, the card is
  still counted toward the maximum.
  “Max X per deck” is restricts the number of copies of that
  card that may be included in each player deck.
  “Max 1 per player” is player specific, and restricts the
  number of copies of that card that each player may control
  in play at a given time.
