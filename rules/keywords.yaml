name: "Keywords"
rule_text: |
  A keyword is an attribute that conveys specific rules to its card. 
  The following keywords are used in the game:
  Guard — While any minions with this keyword are engaged with a 
  player, that player cannot attack villains without this keyword.
  Hinder X — When a card with the hinder X keyword is revealed, place
  X threat on that card.
  Incite X — When a card with the incite X keyword is revealed, place
  X threat on the main scheme.
  Overkill — If an ally is used to defend against an attack with 
  overkill, any excess damage from the attack (damage beyond the 
  ally’s remaining hit points) is dealt to the identity of the player
  controlling the ally, if able.
  If an attack with overkill defeats a minion, excess damage from the 
  attack (damage beyond the minion’s remaining hit points) is dealt
  to the villain.
  Patrol — While any minions with the patrol keyword are engaged with 
  a player, that player cannot thwart the main scheme.
  Peril — While a player is resolving a card with this keyword, that 
  player cannot consult other players, and other player cannot play 
  cards or trigger abilities.
  Permanent — A card with the permanent keyword cannot leave play.
  Piercing — An attack with the piercing keyword discards any tough
  status cards from the target of the attack before dealing damage.
  Quickstrike — After this enemy engages a player, it immediately 
  attacks that player if they are in hero form.
  Ranged — An attack with the ranged keyword ignores the retaliate
  keyword.
  Restricted — A player cannot control more than two restricted cards 
  in play at a given time. If a player ever controls more than two 
  restricted cards in play, they must immediately choose and discard
  from play restricted cards they control until they have only two.
  Retaliate X — After this character is attacked, deal X damage to 
  the attacker. The character must survive the attack to deal this 
  damage. (X is the value next to the retaliate keyword.)

  Setup — A card with the setup keyword begins the game in play.
  Stalwart — A character that has the stalwart keyword cannot be 
  stunned or confused.
  Surge — After an encounter card with this keyword is revealed, the 
  player resolving the card reveals an additional encounter card. 
  Complete the process of resolving the original card before
  revealing the additional card.
  Team-Up — The team-up keyword names two characters. To include a
  card with the team-up keyword in your deck, your chosen identity
  must match one of the two named characters. Additionally, a card
  with the team-up keyword cannot be played unless both of the named
  characters (hero and ally) are in play.
  Toughness — When this character enters play, place a tough status 
  card on it.
  Uses (X “type”) — When a card with this keyword enters play, place 
  X all-purpose counters from the token pool on the card. The word 
  following the value establishes and identifies the type of uses the
  card holds.
  Each card with this keyword also has an ability that references the
  type of use established by the keyword as part of the cost. When
  such an ability spends a use, a counter of that type must be 
  removed from the card.
  After a card with uses spends its final use (and the effect
  resolves), discard the card.
  Victory — When a card with the victory X keyword is defeated, place
  it in the victory display instead of its owner’s discard pile.
  Villainous — When a minion with the villainous keyword activates,
  give it a facedown boost card from the top of the encounter deck.
  When you resolve that minion’s activation, turn the boost card
  faceup and apply its boost icons to the minion’s stats for this
  activation. If the boost card has a boost ability, resolve its
  effects. Discard the boost card after the activation.
