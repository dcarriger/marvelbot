name: "Keywords"
rule_text: |
  A keyword is an attribute that conveys specific rules to its
  card. The following keywords are used in the game:
  Guard — While any minions with this keyword are engaged
  with a player, that player cannot attack villains without this
  keyword.
  Incite X — When a card with the incite X keyword is revealed, place
  X threat on the main scheme.
  Overkill — If an ally is used to defend against an attack
  with overkill, any excess damage from the attack (damage
  beyond the ally’s remaining hit points) is dealt to the
  identity of the player controlling the ally, if able.
  If an attack with overkill defeats a minion, excess damage
  from the attack (damage beyond the minion’s remaining hit
  points) is dealt to the villain.
  Peril — While a player is resolving a card with this keyword,
  that player cannot consult other players, and other players
  cannot play cards or trigger abilities.
  Permanent — A card with the permanent keyword cannot leave play.
  Piercing — An attack with the piercing keyword discards any tough
  status cards from the target of the attack before dealing
  damage.
  Quickstrike — After this enemy engages a player, it
  immediately attacks that player if they are in hero form.
  Ranged — An attack with the ranged keyword ignores the retaliate
  keyword.
  Restricted — A player cannot control more than two
  restricted cards in play at a given time. If a player ever
  controls more than two restricted cards in play, they must
  immediately choose and discard from play restricted cards
  they control until they have only two.
  Retaliate X — After this character is attacked, deal X
  damage to the attacker. The character must survive the
  attack to deal this damage. (X is the value next to the
  retaliate keyword.)

  Setup — A card with the setup keyword begins the game in play.
  Surge — After an encounter card with this keyword is
  revealed, the player resolving the card reveals an additional
  encounter card. Complete the process of resolving the
  original card before revealing the additional card.
  Toughness — When this character enters play, place a
  tough status card on it.
  Uses (X “type”) — When a card with this keyword enters
  play, place X all-purpose counters from the token pool on
  the card. The word following the value establishes and
  identifies the type of uses the card holds.
  Each card with this keyword also has an ability that
  references the type of use established by the keyword
  as part of the cost. When such an ability spends a use, a
  counter of that type must be removed from the card.
  After a card with uses spends its final use (and the effect
  resolves), discard the card.
