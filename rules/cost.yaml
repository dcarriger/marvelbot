name: "Cost"
rule_text: |
  A card’s resource cost is the numerical value that must be
  paid to play the card. Some abilities have a cost described
  in the ability text that must be paid to use
  the ability.
  • An arrow icon (→) in ability text distinguishes a cost
  from an effect, in a “pay cost → resolve effect”
  format.
  • While paying a cost, a player is permitted to generate
  resources beyond the specified cost.
  • Any resources that are generated beyond a required
  cost are lost after paying the cost.
  • If multiple costs for a single card or ability require
  payment, those costs must be paid simultaneously.
  • An ability’s cost cannot be paid if the resolution of
  that ability’s effect could not change the game state.
  • While a player is paying a cost, that player must pay
  costs with cards and/or game elements they control.
  • If a cost requires a game element that is not in
  play, the player paying the cost may only use game
  elements that are in their own out-of-play areas.
