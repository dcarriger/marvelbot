name: "Delayed Effects"
rule_text: |
  Some abilities contain delayed effects. Such abilities specify
  a future timing point, or indicate a future condition that may
  arise, and dictate an effect that is to happen at that time.
  • Delayed effects resolve automatically and
  immediately after their specified timing point or
  future condition occurs or becomes true, and before
  responses to that point or condition may be used.
  • When a delayed effect resolves, it is not treated as a
  new triggered ability, even if the delayed effect was
  originally created by a triggered ability.
