name: "Resource Cards"
rule_text: |
  Resource cards are a player card type. Their primary
  function is to be discarded from a player’s hand to generate
  resources.
  These cards generally provide more (or more efficient)
  resources than other card types when they are discarded
  from a player’s hand to generate resources.
  Some resource cards have card text that is active
  while using the card to generate resources.
