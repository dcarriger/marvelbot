name: "Hit Points"
rule_text: |
  Each character (hero/alter-ego, ally, minion, and villain) has
  a hit point value. Hit points represent the durability of that
  character.
  • If a hero/alter-ego or villain is damaged, apply the
  damage by reducing its hit point dial by the specified
  amount.
  • If a player’s hit point dial is reduced to zero, that
  player has been defeated and is eliminated from the
  game. (See Player Elimination.)
  • If a villain’s hit point dial is reduced to zero, that stage
  of the villain has been defeated. (See Villain Defeat.)
  • If a minion or ally is damaged, track the damage by
  placing damage tokens on the card. Damage tokens
  on a card reduce the card’s remaining hit points by
  the total value of the tokens. An ally or minion with
  zero or fewer remaining hit points is defeated and
  placed in the appropriate discard pile. (See Defeat.)
