name: "Gets"
rule_text: |
  If a card ability causes a character to “get” a statistic (such
  as +1 ATK or 4 hit points), the ability modifies the character’s
  statistic while it is active.
  • If such an ability expires or otherwise becomes
  inactive, the modified statistic reverts to the value it
  would have without the modifier.
  • If such an ability causes a character to get hit points,
  it modifies the character’s remaining hit points
  while the ability remains active, and also modifies
  the character’s maximum hit points while the ability
  remains active.
