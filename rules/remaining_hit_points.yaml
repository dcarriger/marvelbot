name: "Remaining Hit Points"
rule_text: |
  When damage is dealt to a character, it reduces the
  character’s remaining hit points.
  An identity or villain’s remaining hit points are the value on
  the dial.
  If a card references an ally’s or minion’s “remaining hit
  points”, subtract the amount of damage on the card from
  the card’s maximum hit points to determine how many hit
  points the card has remaining.
  If a card has zero (or fewer) remaining hit points, the card is
  defeated.
