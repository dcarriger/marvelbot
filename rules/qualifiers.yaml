name: "Qualifiers"
rule_text: |
  If ability text includes a qualifier followed by multiple terms,
  the qualifier applies to each item in the list, if applicable.

  _For example, in the phrase “each ready character and
  attachment” the word “ready” applies to both “character”
  and “attachment.”_
