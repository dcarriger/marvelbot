rule_text: |
  Status card represent different states a character may find
  themselves in during the game.
  The following status cards are used in the game. When a
  character is given a status card, take a status card of the
  specified type from the pool and place it on that character.
  • A character cannot have more than one status card of
  each type at a time.
  • Status card abilities have timing priority over all
  conflicting card abilities.
  The three status card types are:
  Confused — If a confused hero or ally attempts to thwart
  or use a thwart ability, discard the confused card instead.
  Costs associated with the thwart attempt, including
  exhausting the character, must still be paid.
  If a confused villain or minion would scheme, discard the
  confused status card instead.
  Stunned — If a stunned hero or ally attempts to attack
  or use an attack ability, discard the stunned card instead.
  Costs associated with the attack attempt, including
  exhausting the character, must still be paid.
  If a stunned villain or minion would attack, discard the
  stunned status card instead.
  Tough — If a character with a tough status card would take
  any amount of damage, prevent all of that damage and
  discard the tough status card instead.
