name: "Indirect Damage"
rule_text: |
  Some card abilities may deal “indirect damage.”
  Indirect damage dealt to a player or group of players must
  be split among all characters that the specified player(s)
  control(s).
  While assigning indirect damage, a character cannot
  be assigned more indirect damage than would cause it
  to be defeated. This is assessed without accounting for
  interactions with other abilities.

  _For example, if you take 5 indirect damage, but you control
  an ally in play with 4 hit points remaining, you may assign
  4 of that indirect damage to the ally, then assign the
  remaining 1 indirect damage to your identity._
